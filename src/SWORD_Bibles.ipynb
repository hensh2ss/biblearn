      "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\n",
      "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n",
      "And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\n",
      "And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n",
      "And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n",
      "And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n",
      "And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so.\n",
      "And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n",
      "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:\n",
      "And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.\n",
      "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n",
      "And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,\n",
      "And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n",
      "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n",
      "And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n",
      "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n",
      "And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps on the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n",
      "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\n",
      "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n",
      "And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\n",
      "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n",
      "And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps on the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n",
      "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n",
      "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n",
      "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n",
      "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n",
      "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,\n",
      "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.\n",
      "But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.\n",
      "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n",
      "And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n",
      "And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n",
      "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.\n",
      "The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;\n",
      "And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n",
      "And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.\n",
      "And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n",
      "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\n",
      "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:\n",
      "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.\n",
      "And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n",
      "And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.\n",
      "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.\n",
      "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\n",
      "And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her to the man.\n",
      "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n",
      "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n",
      "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n",
      "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yes, has God said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\n",
      "And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n",
      "But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.\n",
      "And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:\n",
      "For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n",
      "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her; and he did eat.\n",
      "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\n",
      "And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.\n",
      "And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where are you?\n",
      "And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n",
      "And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat?\n",
      "And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n",
      "And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n",
      "And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:\n",
      "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.\n",
      "To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.\n",
      "And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;\n",
      "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;\n",
      "In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.\n",
      "And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.\n",
      "To Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\n",
      "And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\n",
      "Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from from where he was taken.\n",
      "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\n",
      "And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n",
      "And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n",
      "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering:\n",
      "But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Cain, Why are you wroth? and why is your countenance fallen?\n",
      "If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.\n",
      "And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?\n",
      "And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.\n",
      "And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;\n",
      "When you till the ground, it shall not from now on yield to you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth.\n",
      "And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n",
      "Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n",
      "And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n",
      "And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.\n",
      "And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n",
      "And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n",
      "And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.\n",
      "And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\n",
      "And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n",
      "And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n",
      "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n",
      "And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\n",
      "And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.\n",
      "This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;\n",
      "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n",
      "And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:\n",
      "And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n",
      "And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:\n",
      "And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\n",
      "And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:\n",
      "And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n",
      "And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:\n",
      "And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n",
      "And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:\n",
      "And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n",
      "And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:\n",
      "And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n",
      "And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:\n",
      "And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:\n",
      "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n",
      "And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.\n",
      "And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n",
      "And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:\n",
      "And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.\n",
      "And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:\n",
      "And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\n",
      "And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,\n",
      "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n",
      "And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n",
      "There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\n",
      "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n",
      "And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repents me that I have made them.\n",
      "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n",
      "These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.\n",
      "And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n",
      "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n",
      "And God looked on the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way on the earth.\n",
      "And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n",
      "Make you an ark of gopher wood; rooms shall you make in the ark, and shall pitch it within and without with pitch.\n",
      "And this is the fashion which you shall make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n",
      "A window shall you make to the ark, and in a cubit shall you finish it above; and the door of the ark shall you set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shall you make it.\n",
      "And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n",
      "But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.\n",
      "And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.\n",
      "Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.\n",
      "And take you to you of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it to you; and it shall be for food for you, and for them.\n",
      "Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n",
      "Of every clean beast you shall take to you by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.\n",
      "Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.\n",
      "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\n",
      "And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.\n",
      "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.\n",
      "And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n",
      "Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creeps on the earth,\n",
      "There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.\n",
      "And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were on the earth.\n",
      "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n",
      "And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.\n",
      "In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;\n",
      "They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.\n",
      "And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.\n",
      "And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n",
      "And the flood was forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly on the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n",
      "Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\n",
      "And all flesh died that moved on the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man:\n",
      "All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\n",
      "And every living substance was destroyed which was on the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n",
      "And the waters prevailed on the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n",
      "And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;\n",
      "The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;\n",
      "And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\n",
      "And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.\n",
      "And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\n",
      "And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.\n",
      "Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;\n",
      "But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.\n",
      "And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;\n",
      "And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, see, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.\n",
      "And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n",
      "And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\n",
      "And God spoke to Noah, saying,\n",
      "Go forth of the ark, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.\n",
      "Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creeps on the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.\n",
      "And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:\n",
      "Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatever creeps on the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.\n",
      "And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\n",
      "And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n",
      "While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n",
      "And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n",
      "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, and on every fowl of the air, on all that moves on the earth, and on all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n",
      "Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.\n",
      "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.\n",
      "And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.\n",
      "Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\n",
      "And you, be you fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n",
      "And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n",
      "And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;\n",
      "And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n",
      "And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n",
      "And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:\n",
      "I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:\n",
      "And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.\n",
      "And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look on it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.\n",
      "And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.\n",
      "And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n",
      "These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth covered.\n",
      "And Noah began to be an farmer, and he planted a vineyard:\n",
      "And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.\n",
      "And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers without.\n",
      "And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\n",
      "And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.\n",
      "And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n",
      "God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n",
      "And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n",
      "And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.\n",
      "The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n",
      "And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n",
      "And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n",
      "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n",
      "And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n",
      "And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n",
      "And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n",
      "He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n",
      "And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n",
      "Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,\n",
      "And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\n",
      "And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n",
      "And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.\n",
      "And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,\n",
      "And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,\n",
      "And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n",
      "And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.\n",
      "And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you come to Gerar, to Gaza; as you go, to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lasha.\n",
      "These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n",
      "To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n",
      "The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\n",
      "And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n",
      "And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n",
      "And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n",
      "And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n",
      "And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,\n",
      "And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n",
      "And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.\n",
      "And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go to Sephar a mount of the east.\n",
      "These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n",
      "These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n",
      "And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelled there.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.\n",
      "And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.\n",
      "And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n",
      "Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\n",
      "So the LORD scattered them abroad from there on the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n",
      "Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from there did the LORD scatter them abroad on the face of all the earth.\n",
      "These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:\n",
      "And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:\n",
      "And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:\n",
      "And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:\n",
      "And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:\n",
      "And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:\n",
      "And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:\n",
      "And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:\n",
      "And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.\n",
      "And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\n",
      "And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n",
      "And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n",
      "But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n",
      "And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.\n",
      "And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.\n",
      "Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:\n",
      "And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing:\n",
      "And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.\n",
      "And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.\n",
      "And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.\n",
      "And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n",
      "And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look on:\n",
      "Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.\n",
      "Say, I pray you, you are my sister: that it may be well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n",
      "The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.\n",
      "And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.\n",
      "And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? why did you not tell me that she was your wife?\n",
      "Why said you, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way.\n",
      "And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.\n",
      "And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.\n",
      "And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n",
      "And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;\n",
      "To the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\n",
      "And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.\n",
      "And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.\n",
      "And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.\n",
      "Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n",
      "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.\n",
      "Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n",
      "Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n",
      "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:\n",
      "For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.\n",
      "And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.\n",
      "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you.\n",
      "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;\n",
      "That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n",
      "All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.\n",
      "Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.\n",
      "And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\n",
      "And the Horites in their mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n",
      "And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.\n",
      "And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;\n",
      "With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.\n",
      "And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n",
      "And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.\n",
      "And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelled in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.\n",
      "And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n",
      "And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.\n",
      "And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n",
      "And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n",
      "And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.\n",
      "And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.\n",
      "And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:\n",
      "And blessed be the most high God, which has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him tithes of all.\n",
      "And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to yourself.\n",
      "And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n",
      "That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich:\n",
      "Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.\n",
      "After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.\n",
      "And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n",
      "And Abram said, Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, see, one born in my house is my heir.\n",
      "And, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be your heir; but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir.\n",
      "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.\n",
      "And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\n",
      "And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.\n",
      "And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n",
      "And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\n",
      "And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n",
      "And when the fowls came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.\n",
      "And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and, see, an horror of great darkness fell on him.\n",
      "And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;\n",
      "And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\n",
      "And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.\n",
      "But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.\n",
      "In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:\n",
      "The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,\n",
      "And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,\n",
      "And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n",
      "And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing: I pray you, go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.\n",
      "And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n",
      "And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on you: I have given my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and you.\n",
      "But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your maid is in your hand; do to her as it pleases you. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n",
      "And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, from where came you? and where will you go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, you are with child and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael; because the LORD has heard your affliction.\n",
      "And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.\n",
      "And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?\n",
      "Why the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n",
      "And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.\n",
      "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.\n",
      "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.\n",
      "And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.\n",
      "And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n",
      "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.\n",
      "Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.\n",
      "And I will make you exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you.\n",
      "And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you, and to your seed after you.\n",
      "And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, You shall keep my covenant therefore, you, and your seed after you in their generations.\n",
      "This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\n",
      "And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.\n",
      "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.\n",
      "He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n",
      "And I will bless her, and give you a son also of her: yes, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.\n",
      "Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?\n",
      "And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before you!\n",
      "And God said, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed; and you shall call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n",
      "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n",
      "But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear to you at this set time in the next year.\n",
      "And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n",
      "And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said to him.\n",
      "And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n",
      "And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;\n",
      "And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, see, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,\n",
      "And said, My LORD, if now I have found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from your servant:\n",
      "Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:\n",
      "And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.\n",
      "And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.\n",
      "And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hurried to dress it.\n",
      "And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n",
      "And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n",
      "And he said, I will certainly return to you according to the time of life; and, see, Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n",
      "Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n",
      "Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n",
      "Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, No; but you did laugh.\n",
      "And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;\n",
      "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n",
      "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n",
      "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.\n",
      "And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n",
      "And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\n",
      "That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n",
      "And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n",
      "And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken on me to speak to the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:\n",
      "Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n",
      "And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.\n",
      "And he said to him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, I have taken on me to speak to the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n",
      "And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\n",
      "And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.\n",
      "And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.\n",
      "And he pressed on them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n",
      "But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:\n",
      "And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.\n",
      "And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,\n",
      "And said, I pray you, brothers, do not so wickedly.\n",
      "Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n",
      "And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with you, than with them. And they pressed sore on the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.\n",
      "But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.\n",
      "And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n",
      "And the men said to Lot, Have you here any besides? son in law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whatever you have in the city, bring them out of this place:\n",
      "For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.\n",
      "And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked to his sons in law.\n",
      "And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n",
      "And while he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.\n",
      "And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my LORD:\n",
      "Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:\n",
      "Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.\n",
      "And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.\n",
      "Haste you, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till you be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n",
      "The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n",
      "Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;\n",
      "And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\n",
      "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n",
      "And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:\n",
      "And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.\n",
      "And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n",
      "And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:\n",
      "Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n",
      "And the first born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.\n",
      "And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\n",
      "And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n",
      "But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you are but a dead man, for the woman which you have taken; for she is a man's wife.\n",
      "But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, will you slay also a righteous nation?\n",
      "Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.\n",
      "And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.\n",
      "Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live: and if you restore her not, know you that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.\n",
      "Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n",
      "Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? and what have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Abraham, What saw you, that you have done this thing?\n",
      "And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n",
      "And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\n",
      "And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you: dwell where it pleases you.\n",
      "And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, to all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.\n",
      "So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.\n",
      "For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n",
      "And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\n",
      "And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n",
      "And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.\n",
      "And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.\n",
      "And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\n",
      "And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born to Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "Why she said to Abraham, Cast out this female slave and her son: for the son of this female slave shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\n",
      "And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.\n",
      "And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your female slave; in all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.\n",
      "And also of the son of the female slave will I make a nation, because he is your seed.\n",
      "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n",
      "And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n",
      "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand; for I will make him a great nation.\n",
      "And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n",
      "And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelled in the wilderness, and became an archer.\n",
      "And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:\n",
      "Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned.\n",
      "And Abraham said, I will swear.\n",
      "And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing; neither did you tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\n",
      "And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.\n",
      "And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?\n",
      "And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shall you take of my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have dig this well.\n",
      "Why he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.\n",
      "Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n",
      "And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n",
      "And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.\n",
      "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n",
      "And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n",
      "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.\n",
      "And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n",
      "And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n",
      "And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on the wood.\n",
      "And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Lay not your hand on the lad, neither do you any thing to him: for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me.\n",
      "And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.\n",
      "And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham out of heaven the second time,\n",
      "And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:\n",
      "That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\n",
      "And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.\n",
      "So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelled at Beersheba.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also born children to your brother Nahor;\n",
      "Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n",
      "And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n",
      "And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.\n",
      "And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n",
      "And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.\n",
      "And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n",
      "And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,\n",
      "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burial plot with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\n",
      "And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, but that you may bury your dead.\n",
      "And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.\n",
      "And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n",
      "That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a burial plot among you.\n",
      "And Ephron dwelled among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n",
      "No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.\n",
      "And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n",
      "And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me: I will give you money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.\n",
      "And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "My lord, listen to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead.\n",
      "And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n",
      "And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure\n",
      "To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n",
      "And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burial plot by the sons of Heth.\n",
      "And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.\n",
      "And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:\n",
      "And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:\n",
      "But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.\n",
      "And the servant said to him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring your son again to the land from from where you came?\n",
      "And Abraham said to him, Beware you that you bring not my son thither again.\n",
      "The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke to me, and that swore to me, saying, To your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from there.\n",
      "And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n",
      "And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.\n",
      "And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\n",
      "And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.\n",
      "And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, send me good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\n",
      "Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:\n",
      "And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness to my master.\n",
      "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.\n",
      "And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.\n",
      "And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher.\n",
      "And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.\n",
      "And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have done drinking.\n",
      "And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n",
      "And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;\n",
      "And said, Whose daughter are you? tell me, I pray you: is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?\n",
      "And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bore to Nahor.\n",
      "She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.\n",
      "And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brothers.\n",
      "And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.\n",
      "And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n",
      "And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; why stand you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n",
      "And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.\n",
      "And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.\n",
      "And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n",
      "And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him has he given all that he has.\n",
      "And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n",
      "But you shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son.\n",
      "And I said to my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.\n",
      "And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:\n",
      "Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give not you one, you shall be clear from my oath.\n",
      "And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:\n",
      "Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;\n",
      "And she say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master's son.\n",
      "And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.\n",
      "And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n",
      "And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the earring on her face, and the bracelets on her hands.\n",
      "And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter to his son.\n",
      "And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n",
      "Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak to you bad or good.\n",
      "Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n",
      "And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\n",
      "And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.\n",
      "And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n",
      "And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n",
      "And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n",
      "And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n",
      "And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.\n",
      "And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\n",
      "And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n",
      "And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelled in the south country.\n",
      "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\n",
      "And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.\n",
      "For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.\n",
      "And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n",
      "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.\n",
      "Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n",
      "And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n",
      "And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n",
      "And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n",
      "And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.\n",
      "But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.\n",
      "And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred three score and fifteen years.\n",
      "Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;\n",
      "The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelled by the well Lahairoi.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham:\n",
      "And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n",
      "And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n",
      "Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n",
      "These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n",
      "And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And they dwelled from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brothers.\n",
      "And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n",
      "And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.\n",
      "And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n",
      "And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\n",
      "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n",
      "And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.\n",
      "And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.\n",
      "And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n",
      "And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.\n",
      "And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:\n",
      "And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n",
      "And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.\n",
      "And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?\n",
      "And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob.\n",
      "Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.\n",
      "And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:\n",
      "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father;\n",
      "And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\n",
      "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n",
      "And Isaac dwelled in Gerar:\n",
      "And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look on.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n",
      "And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is your wife; and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? one of the people might lightly have lien with your wife, and you should have brought guiltiness on us.\n",
      "And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:\n",
      "For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.\n",
      "For all the wells which his father's servants had dig in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.\n",
      "And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.\n",
      "And Isaac departed there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelled there.\n",
      "And Isaac dig again the wells of water, which they had dig in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.\n",
      "And Isaac's servants dig in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.\n",
      "And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.\n",
      "And they dig another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.\n",
      "And he removed from there, and dig another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\n",
      "And he went up from there to Beersheba.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n",
      "And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.\n",
      "Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n",
      "And Isaac said to them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?\n",
      "And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;\n",
      "That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.\n",
      "And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n",
      "And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dig, and said to him, We have found water.\n",
      "And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.\n",
      "And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n",
      "Which were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebekah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:\n",
      "Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;\n",
      "And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.\n",
      "And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n",
      "And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,\n",
      "Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.\n",
      "Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:\n",
      "And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\n",
      "My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.\n",
      "And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n",
      "And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n",
      "And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her oldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son:\n",
      "And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck:\n",
      "And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n",
      "And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?\n",
      "And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.\n",
      "And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.\n",
      "And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.\n",
      "And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n",
      "And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n",
      "And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n",
      "And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n",
      "And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n",
      "And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:\n",
      "Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n",
      "Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n",
      "And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me.\n",
      "And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.\n",
      "And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.\n",
      "And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n",
      "And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.\n",
      "And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\n",
      "And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?\n",
      "And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;\n",
      "And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.\n",
      "And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n",
      "And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;\n",
      "And tarry with him a few days, until your brother's fury turn away;\n",
      "Until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?\n",
      "And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\n",
      "And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n",
      "Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.\n",
      "And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;\n",
      "And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.\n",
      "And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n",
      "When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from there; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;\n",
      "And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;\n",
      "And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n",
      "Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\n",
      "And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n",
      "And he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n",
      "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\n",
      "And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: the land where on you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed;\n",
      "And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.\n",
      "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.\n",
      "And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n",
      "And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.\n",
      "And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.\n",
      "And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n",
      "So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:\n",
      "And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.\n",
      "Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.\n",
      "And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, see, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was on the well's mouth.\n",
      "And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in his place.\n",
      "And Jacob said to them, My brothers, from where be you? And they said, Of Haran are we.\n",
      "And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.\n",
      "And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.\n",
      "And he said, See, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water you the sheep, and go and feed them.\n",
      "And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.\n",
      "And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n",
      "And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n",
      "And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him the space of a month.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall your wages be?\n",
      "And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n",
      "Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.\n",
      "And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.\n",
      "And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n",
      "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.\n",
      "And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.\n",
      "And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? why then have you beguiled me?\n",
      "And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.\n",
      "Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.\n",
      "And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n",
      "And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.\n",
      "And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.\n",
      "And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.\n",
      "And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n",
      "And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\n",
      "And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n",
      "And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in to her.\n",
      "And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n",
      "And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n",
      "When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n",
      "And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "And Leah said, A troop comes: and she called his name Gad.\n",
      "And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.\n",
      "And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.\n",
      "And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? and would you take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with you to night for your son's mandrakes.\n",
      "And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n",
      "And God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n",
      "And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.\n",
      "And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n",
      "And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.\n",
      "And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:\n",
      "And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.\n",
      "Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you.\n",
      "And Laban said to him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.\n",
      "And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.\n",
      "And he said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle was with me.\n",
      "For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?\n",
      "And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.\n",
      "I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.\n",
      "So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n",
      "And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word.\n",
      "And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n",
      "And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n",
      "And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n",
      "And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not to Laban's cattle.\n",
      "And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n",
      "But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n",
      "And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's has he gotten all this glory.\n",
      "And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.\n",
      "And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,\n",
      "And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.\n",
      "And you know that with all my power I have served your father.\n",
      "And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n",
      "If he said thus, The speckled shall be your wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be your hire; then bore all the cattle ringstraked.\n",
      "Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped on the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see, all the rams which leap on the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted: for I have seen all that Laban does to you.\n",
      "I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.\n",
      "And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?\n",
      "Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money.\n",
      "For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatever God has said to you, do.\n",
      "Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on camels;\n",
      "And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.\n",
      "And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.\n",
      "So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n",
      "And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brothers pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?\n",
      "Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n",
      "And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.\n",
      "It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?\n",
      "And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure you would take by force your daughters from me.\n",
      "With whomsoever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brothers discern you what is your with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n",
      "And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n",
      "Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is on me. And he searched but found not the images.\n",
      "And Jacob was wroth, and strived with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?\n",
      "Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.\n",
      "This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.\n",
      "That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n",
      "Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.\n",
      "Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.\n",
      "And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have born?\n",
      "Now therefore come you, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.\n",
      "And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there on the heap.\n",
      "And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n",
      "And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day.  Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n",
      "And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:\n",
      "This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\n",
      "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.\n",
      "Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.\n",
      "And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.\n",
      "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak to my lord Esau; Your servant Jacob said thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:\n",
      "And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.\n",
      "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.\n",
      "Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;\n",
      "And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n",
      "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:\n",
      "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.\n",
      "Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.\n",
      "And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n",
      "And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;\n",
      "Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\n",
      "Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n",
      "And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.\n",
      "And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where go you? and whose are these before you?\n",
      "Then you shall say, They be your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\n",
      "And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak to Esau, when you find him.\n",
      "And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n",
      "So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.\n",
      "And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n",
      "And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.\n",
      "And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n",
      "And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.\n",
      "And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.\n",
      "And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.\n",
      "And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you do ask after my name? And he blessed him there.\n",
      "And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n",
      "And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he halted on his thigh.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n",
      "And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.\n",
      "And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.\n",
      "And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n",
      "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with you? And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant.\n",
      "Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you have to yourself.\n",
      "And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.\n",
      "Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.\n",
      "And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n",
      "Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.\n",
      "And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.\n",
      "And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n",
      "And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.\n",
      "And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.\n",
      "And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n",
      "And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.\n",
      "And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n",
      "And his soul joined to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.\n",
      "And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.\n",
      "And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.\n",
      "And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.\n",
      "And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.\n",
      "And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\n",
      "And make you marriages with us, and give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.\n",
      "And you shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade you therein, and get you possessions therein.\n",
      "And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what you shall say to me I will give.\n",
      "Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say to me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n",
      "And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\n",
      "And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach to us:\n",
      "But in this will we consent to you: If you will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;\n",
      "Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n",
      "But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n",
      "And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n",
      "And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.\n",
      "And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,\n",
      "These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n",
      "Only herein will the men consent to us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.\n",
      "Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.\n",
      "And to Hamor and to Shechem his son listened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came on the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n",
      "And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.\n",
      "The sons of Jacob came on the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.\n",
      "They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,\n",
      "And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n",
      "And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\n",
      "And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, that appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.\n",
      "Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:\n",
      "And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n",
      "And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.\n",
      "And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n",
      "So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.\n",
      "And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n",
      "But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\n",
      "And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.\n",
      "And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.\n",
      "And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;\n",
      "And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.\n",
      "And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n",
      "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.\n",
      "And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.\n",
      "And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; you shall have this son also.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.\n",
      "And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.\n",
      "And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.\n",
      "And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:\n",
      "The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:\n",
      "The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:\n",
      "And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:\n",
      "And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n",
      "And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n",
      "And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n",
      "And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n",
      "Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;\n",
      "And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.\n",
      "And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;\n",
      "And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born to him in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n",
      "For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.\n",
      "Thus dwelled Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n",
      "And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:\n",
      "These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.\n",
      "And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.\n",
      "And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.\n",
      "And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.\n",
      "These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,\n",
      "Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.\n",
      "And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.\n",
      "These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.\n",
      "These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,\n",
      "And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.\n",
      "And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.\n",
      "And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.\n",
      "And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.\n",
      "And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.\n",
      "And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.\n",
      "The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.\n",
      "The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.\n",
      "These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,\n",
      "Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.\n",
      "And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.\n",
      "And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.\n",
      "And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.\n",
      "And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,\n",
      "Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,\n",
      "Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,\n",
      "Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.\n",
      "And Jacob dwelled in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.\n",
      "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.\n",
      "And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.\n",
      "And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.\n",
      "And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\n",
      "For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, see, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n",
      "And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.\n",
      "And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n",
      "And he told it to his father, and to his brothers: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed?  Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?\n",
      "And his brothers envied him; but his father observed the saying.\n",
      "And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n",
      "And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?\n",
      "And he said, I seek my brothers: tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks.\n",
      "And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.\n",
      "And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.\n",
      "Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\n",
      "And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.\n",
      "And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand on him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joseph was come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;\n",
      "And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.\n",
      "And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.\n",
      "And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?\n",
      "Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be on him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers were content.\n",
      "Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n",
      "And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.\n",
      "And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?\n",
      "And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;\n",
      "And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be your son's coat or no.\n",
      "And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n",
      "And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.\n",
      "And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n",
      "And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n",
      "And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.\n",
      "And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.\n",
      "And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.\n",
      "And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.\n",
      "And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\n",
      "And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.\n",
      "And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.\n",
      "And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\n",
      "And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: why he slew him also.\n",
      "Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brothers did. And Tamar went and dwelled in her father's house.\n",
      "And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n",
      "And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.\n",
      "And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.\n",
      "When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.\n",
      "And he turned to her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you, let me come in to you; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?\n",
      "And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?\n",
      "And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.\n",
      "And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n",
      "And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n",
      "Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.\n",
      "And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n",
      "When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.\n",
      "And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be on you: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n",
      "And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread on his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n",
      "And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\n",
      "And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n",
      "And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n",
      "And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n",
      "And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n",
      "And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n",
      "But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;\n",
      "There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\n",
      "And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n",
      "And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.\n",
      "And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,\n",
      "That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew to us to mock us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.\n",
      "And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n",
      "And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me:\n",
      "And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did your servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\n",
      "But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n",
      "And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.\n",
      "The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n",
      "And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n",
      "And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.\n",
      "And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.\n",
      "And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on them, and, behold, they were sad.\n",
      "And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look you so sadly to day?\n",
      "And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n",
      "And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\n",
      "And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:\n",
      "And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n",
      "And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.\n",
      "But think on me when it shall be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\n",
      "For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\n",
      "When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:\n",
      "And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket on my head.\n",
      "And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.\n",
      "And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n",
      "And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:\n",
      "But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n",
      "Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow.\n",
      "And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favored and skinney; and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river.\n",
      "And the ill favored and skinney cows did eat up the seven well favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.\n",
      "And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.\n",
      "And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:\n",
      "Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:\n",
      "And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.\n",
      "And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river:\n",
      "And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:\n",
      "And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favored and skinney, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:\n",
      "And the lean and the ill favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:\n",
      "And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:\n",
      "And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:\n",
      "And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n",
      "And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n",
      "The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.\n",
      "And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.\n",
      "This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:\n",
      "And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;\n",
      "And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\n",
      "And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n",
      "Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.\n",
      "And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.\n",
      "And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.\n",
      "And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, For as much as God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:\n",
      "You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;\n",
      "And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.\n",
      "And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\n",
      "And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n",
      "And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.\n",
      "And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n",
      "And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n",
      "And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.\n",
      "And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n",
      "And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he said to you, do.\n",
      "And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n",
      "Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do you look one on another?\n",
      "And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die.\n",
      "And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n",
      "But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n",
      "And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n",
      "And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, From where come you? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n",
      "And Joseph knew his brothers, but they knew not him.\n",
      "And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you are come.\n",
      "And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come.\n",
      "We are all one man's sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.\n",
      "And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you are come.\n",
      "And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spoke to you, saying, You are spies:\n",
      "Hereby you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come here.\n",
      "Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.\n",
      "And he put them all together into ward three days.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:\n",
      "If you be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison: go you, carry corn for the famine of your houses:\n",
      "But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.\n",
      "And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.\n",
      "And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\n",
      "And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.\n",
      "And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n",
      "Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.\n",
      "And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed there.\n",
      "And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.\n",
      "And he said to his brothers, My money is restored; and, see, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?\n",
      "And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell to them; saying,\n",
      "The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n",
      "We be twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, Hereby shall I know that you are true men; leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:\n",
      "And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall traffic in the land.\n",
      "And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n",
      "And Jacob their father said to them, Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.\n",
      "And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.\n",
      "And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "And the famine was sore in the land.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n",
      "And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n",
      "If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food:\n",
      "But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n",
      "And Israel said, Why dealt you so ill with me, as to tell the man whether you had yet a brother?\n",
      "And they said, The man asked us straightly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?\n",
      "And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.\n",
      "I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him: if I bring him not to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever:\n",
      "For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.\n",
      "And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n",
      "And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n",
      "Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:\n",
      "And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\n",
      "And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n",
      "And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.\n",
      "And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.\n",
      "And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our asses.\n",
      "And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,\n",
      "And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:\n",
      "And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n",
      "And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n",
      "And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.\n",
      "And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n",
      "And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n",
      "And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.\n",
      "And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?\n",
      "And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.\n",
      "And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.\n",
      "And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.\n",
      "And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n",
      "And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.\n",
      "And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n",
      "And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.\n",
      "And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.\n",
      "And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.\n",
      "And they said to him, Why said my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:\n",
      "Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?\n",
      "With whomsoever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.\n",
      "And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you shall be blameless.\n",
      "Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.\n",
      "And he searched, and began at the oldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n",
      "Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.\n",
      "And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n",
      "And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n",
      "And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace to your father.\n",
      "Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.\n",
      "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?\n",
      "And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.\n",
      "And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.\n",
      "And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n",
      "And you said to your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you shall see my face no more.\n",
      "And it came to pass when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n",
      "And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.\n",
      "And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons:\n",
      "And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:\n",
      "And if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n",
      "It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.\n",
      "For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n",
      "Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.\n",
      "And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.\n",
      "Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\n",
      "For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be ripening nor harvest.\n",
      "And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n",
      "So now it was not you that sent me here, but God: and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Haste you, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus said your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, tarry not:\n",
      "And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:\n",
      "And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.\n",
      "And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.\n",
      "And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall haste and bring down my father here.\n",
      "And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.\n",
      "Moreover he kissed all his brothers, and wept on them: and after that his brothers talked with him.\n",
      "And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, This do you; lade your beasts, and go, get you to the land of Canaan;\n",
      "And take your father and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.\n",
      "Now you are commanded, this do you; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n",
      "Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n",
      "To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.\n",
      "And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.\n",
      "So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you fall not out by the way.\n",
      "And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father,\n",
      "And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.\n",
      "And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:\n",
      "And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.\n",
      "And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.\n",
      "And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, I am God, the God of your father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation:\n",
      "I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again: and Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.\n",
      "And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n",
      "And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:\n",
      "His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.\n",
      "And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n",
      "And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.\n",
      "And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n",
      "And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n",
      "And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.\n",
      "And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.\n",
      "And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.\n",
      "These be the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.\n",
      "And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.\n",
      "And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.\n",
      "These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.\n",
      "The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.\n",
      "And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.\n",
      "And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\n",
      "These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.\n",
      "And the sons of Dan; Hushim.\n",
      "And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.\n",
      "These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven.\n",
      "All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were three score and six;\n",
      "And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.\n",
      "And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are yet alive.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come to me;\n",
      "And the men are shepherds, for their trade has been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?\n",
      "That you shall say, Your servants' trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n",
      "Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And he took some of his brothers, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.\n",
      "They said morever to Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers are come to you:\n",
      "The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n",
      "And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old are you?\n",
      "And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n",
      "And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n",
      "And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.\n",
      "And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n",
      "And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n",
      "And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? for the money fails.\n",
      "And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.\n",
      "And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.\n",
      "When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n",
      "Why shall we die before your eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.\n",
      "And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n",
      "And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n",
      "Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: why they sold not their lands.\n",
      "Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: see, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass in the increase, that you shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.\n",
      "And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n",
      "And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\n",
      "And Israel dwelled in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.\n",
      "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\n",
      "And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:\n",
      "But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial plot. And he said, I will do as you have said.\n",
      "And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, your father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n",
      "And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.\n",
      "And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n",
      "And said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people; and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.\n",
      "And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n",
      "And your issue, which you beget after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.\n",
      "And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.\n",
      "And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?\n",
      "And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.\n",
      "Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.  And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, see, God has showed me also your seed.\n",
      "And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n",
      "And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.\n",
      "And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n",
      "And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long to this day,\n",
      "The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.\n",
      "And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.\n",
      "And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n",
      "And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n",
      "And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.\n",
      "Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n",
      "And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.\n",
      "Gather yourselves together, and hear, you sons of Jacob; and listen to Israel your father.\n",
      "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:\n",
      "Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.\n",
      "Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.\n",
      "O my soul, come not you into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not you united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they dig down a wall.\n",
      "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n",
      "Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise: your hand shall be in the neck of your enemies; your father's children shall bow down before you.\n",
      "Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?\n",
      "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.\n",
      "Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:\n",
      "His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\n",
      "Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.\n",
      "Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:\n",
      "And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.\n",
      "Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\n",
      "I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.\n",
      "Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.\n",
      "Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\n",
      "Naphtali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words.\n",
      "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:\n",
      "The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:\n",
      "But his bow stayed in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)\n",
      "Even by the God of your father, who shall help you; and by the Almighty, who shall bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:\n",
      "The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brothers.\n",
      "Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\n",
      "All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.\n",
      "And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,\n",
      "In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial plot.\n",
      "There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\n",
      "The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.\n",
      "And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "And Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.\n",
      "And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n",
      "And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him three score and ten days.\n",
      "And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n",
      "My father made me swear, saying, See, I die: in my grave which I have dig for me in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.\n",
      "And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n",
      "And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.\n",
      "And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n",
      "And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: why the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.\n",
      "And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:\n",
      "For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n",
      "And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n",
      "And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.\n",
      "And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,\n",
      "So shall you say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did to you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\n",
      "And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be your servants.\n",
      "And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\n",
      "But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it to good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\n",
      "Now therefore fear you not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.  And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.\n",
      "And Joseph dwelled in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n",
      "And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph's knees.\n",
      "And Joseph said to his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n",
      "And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.\n",
      "So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n",
      "Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n",
      "Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,\n",
      "Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,\n",
      "Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n",
      "And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n",
      "And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.\n",
      "And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.\n",
      "Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\n",
      "And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:\n",
      "Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.\n",
      "Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.\n",
      "But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.  And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:\n",
      "And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:\n",
      "And he said, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.\n",
      "But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?\n",
      "And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.\n",
      "Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.\n",
      "And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.\n",
      "And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.\n",
      "And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.\n",
      "And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\n",
      "And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\n",
      "And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\n",
      "And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n",
      "And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.\n",
      "Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?\n",
      "And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.\n",
      "And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.\n",
      "And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.\n",
      "And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n",
      "And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smite you your fellow?\n",
      "And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.\n",
      "Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.\n",
      "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.\n",
      "And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.\n",
      "And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?\n",
      "And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.\n",
      "And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n",
      "And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.\n",
      "And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n",
      "And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage.\n",
      "And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n",
      "And God looked on the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.\n",
      "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n",
      "And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.\n",
      "Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;\n",
      "And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.\n",
      "Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n",
      "And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.\n",
      "And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say to them?\n",
      "And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.\n",
      "And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.\n",
      "Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:\n",
      "And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.\n",
      "And they shall listen to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n",
      "And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.\n",
      "And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.\n",
      "And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty.\n",
      "But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.\n",
      "And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice: for they will say, The LORD has not appeared to you.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod.\n",
      "And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:\n",
      "That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.\n",
      "And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\n",
      "And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood on the dry land.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?\n",
      "Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall say.\n",
      "And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.\n",
      "And you shall speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.\n",
      "And he shall be your spokesman to the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him instead of God.\n",
      "And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do signs.\n",
      "And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brothers which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought your life.\n",
      "And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.\n",
      "And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:\n",
      "And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.\n",
      "And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.\n",
      "Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.\n",
      "So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband you are, because of the circumcision.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\n",
      "And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.\n",
      "And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\n",
      "And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n",
      "And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and you make them rest from their burdens.\n",
      "And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,\n",
      "You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.\n",
      "And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n",
      "Let there more work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain words.\n",
      "And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.\n",
      "Go you, get you straw where you can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.\n",
      "So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\n",
      "And the taskmasters hurried them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.\n",
      "And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?\n",
      "Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why deal you thus with your servants?\n",
      "There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.\n",
      "But he said, You are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall you deliver the tale of bricks.\n",
      "And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, You shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.\n",
      "And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:\n",
      "And they said to them, The LORD look on you, and judge; because you have made our smell to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.\n",
      "And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, LORD, why have you so evil entreated this people? why is it that you have sent me?\n",
      "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.\n",
      "Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.\n",
      "And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD:\n",
      "And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.\n",
      "And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.\n",
      "And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.\n",
      "Why say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:\n",
      "And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, which brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\n",
      "And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they listened not to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n",
      "And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.\n",
      "And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.\n",
      "And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.\n",
      "The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.\n",
      "And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.\n",
      "And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.\n",
      "And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.\n",
      "And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.\n",
      "And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.\n",
      "And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.\n",
      "And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.\n",
      "And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bore him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.\n",
      "These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.\n",
      "These are they which spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,\n",
      "That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak you to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.\n",
      "And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.\n",
      "You shall speak all that I command you: and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.\n",
      "And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "But Pharaoh shall not listen to you, that I may lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.\n",
      "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.\n",
      "And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.\n",
      "For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.\n",
      "And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.\n",
      "Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.\n",
      "And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, till now you would not hear.\n",
      "Thus said the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n",
      "And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.\n",
      "And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he listen to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.\n",
      "And all the Egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n",
      "And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your borders with frogs:\n",
      "And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:\n",
      "And the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?\n",
      "And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to your word: that you may know that there is none like to the LORD our God.\n",
      "And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\n",
      "And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\n",
      "And they gathered them together on heaps: and the land stank.\n",
      "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice on man, and on beast.\n",
      "Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; see, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.\n",
      "And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the middle of the earth.\n",
      "And I will put a division between my people and your people: to morrow shall this sign be.\n",
      "And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go you, sacrifice to your God in the land.\n",
      "And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?\n",
      "We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.\n",
      "And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.\n",
      "And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.\n",
      "Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,\n",
      "Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\n",
      "And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.\n",
      "And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\n",
      "And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.\n",
      "And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains on man, and on beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains on man, and on beast.\n",
      "And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "For I will at this time send all my plagues on your heart, and on your servants, and on your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.\n",
      "For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite you and your people with pestilence; and you shall be cut off from the earth.\n",
      "And in very deed for this cause have I raised you up, for to show in you my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.\n",
      "As yet exalt you yourself against my people, that you will not let them go?\n",
      "Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.\n",
      "Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.\n",
      "He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:\n",
      "And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.\n",
      "So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.\n",
      "And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.\n",
      "Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.\n",
      "And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.\n",
      "Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.\n",
      "And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.\n",
      "But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.\n",
      "And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.\n",
      "But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.\n",
      "And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.\n",
      "And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.\n",
      "And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs before him:\n",
      "And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have worked in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know how that I am the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.\n",
      "Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:\n",
      "And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field:\n",
      "And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?\n",
      "And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.\n",
      "And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\n",
      "Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\n",
      "And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\n",
      "For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\n",
      "Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.\n",
      "And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.\n",
      "But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:\n",
      "They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go you, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.\n",
      "And Moses said, You must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n",
      "Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\n",
      "But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.\n",
      "And Moses said, You have spoken well, I will see your face again no more.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.\n",
      "Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.\n",
      "And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.  Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.\n",
      "And Moses said, Thus said the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the middle of Egypt:\n",
      "And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\n",
      "And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n",
      "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that you may know how that the LORD does put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n",
      "And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get you out, and all the people that follow you: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not listen to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,\n",
      "This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.\n",
      "Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:\n",
      "And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\n",
      "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:\n",
      "And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\n",
      "And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.\n",
      "And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\n",
      "Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the entrails thereof.\n",
      "And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.\n",
      "And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.\n",
      "For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\n",
      "And the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.\n",
      "And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.\n",
      "And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.\n",
      "Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.\n",
      "You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall you eat unleavened bread.\n",
      "Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.\n",
      "And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.\n",
      "For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.\n",
      "And you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons for ever.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when you be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?\n",
      "That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n",
      "And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n",
      "And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.\n",
      "Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.\n",
      "And the Egyptians were urgent on the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\n",
      "And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:\n",
      "And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\n",
      "And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.\n",
      "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.\n",
      "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "It is a night to be much observed to the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:\n",
      "But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.\n",
      "A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.\n",
      "In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone thereof.\n",
      "All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\n",
      "And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.\n",
      "One law shall be to him that is home born, and to the stranger that sojournes among you.\n",
      "Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n",
      "And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n",
      "And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.\n",
      "This day came you out in the month Abib.\n",
      "And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.\n",
      "Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.\n",
      "Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you in all your quarters.\n",
      "And you shall show your son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "And it shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand has the LORD brought you out of Egypt.\n",
      "You shall therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.\n",
      "And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,\n",
      "That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.\n",
      "And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.\n",
      "And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.\n",
      "And it shall be for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:\n",
      "But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\n",
      "And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.\n",
      "And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:\n",
      "He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall you encamp by the sea.\n",
      "For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in.\n",
      "And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored on Pharaoh, and on all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n",
      "And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?\n",
      "And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:\n",
      "And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n",
      "And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.\n",
      "But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\n",
      "And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.\n",
      "And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?\n",
      "Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n",
      "And Moses said to the people, Fear you not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom you have seen to day, you shall see them again no more for ever.\n",
      "The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Why cry you to me? speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:\n",
      "But lift you up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the middle of the sea.\n",
      "And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.\n",
      "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.\n",
      "And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:\n",
      "And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.\n",
      "And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.\n",
      "And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the middle of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,\n",
      "And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.\n",
      "And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.\n",
      "And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.\n",
      "But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.\n",
      "Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore.\n",
      "And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did on the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.\n",
      "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.\n",
      "The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.\n",
      "The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\n",
      "Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\n",
      "The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.\n",
      "Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.\n",
      "And in the greatness of your excellency you have overthrown them that rose up against you: you sent forth your wrath, which consumed them as stubble.\n",
      "And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.\n",
      "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied on them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.\n",
      "You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.\n",
      "Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?\n",
      "You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n",
      "You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.\n",
      "The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.\n",
      "Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold on them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.\n",
      "Fear and dread shall fall on them; by the greatness of your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which you have purchased.\n",
      "You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.\n",
      "The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\n",
      "For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.\n",
      "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.\n",
      "And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.\n",
      "So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.\n",
      "And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.\n",
      "And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?\n",
      "And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,\n",
      "And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.\n",
      "And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and three score and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n",
      "And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n",
      "Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At even, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:\n",
      "And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he hears your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that you murmur against us?\n",
      "And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he has heard your murmurings.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, At even you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.\n",
      "And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.\n",
      "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take you every man for them which are in his tents.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.\n",
      "And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.\n",
      "And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n",
      "Notwithstanding they listened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.\n",
      "And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.\n",
      "And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n",
      "And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n",
      "And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath to the LORD: to day you shall not find it in the field.\n",
      "Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse you to keep my commandments and my laws?\n",
      "See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.\n",
      "So the people rested on the seventh day.\n",
      "And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.\n",
      "And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n",
      "And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.\n",
      "Why the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do you tempt the LORD?\n",
      "And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?\n",
      "And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they be almost ready to stone me.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go.\n",
      "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?\n",
      "Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n",
      "And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.\n",
      "So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n",
      "But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n",
      "And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\n",
      "And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:\n",
      "For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n",
      "When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;\n",
      "Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,\n",
      "And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:\n",
      "And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:\n",
      "And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:\n",
      "And he said to Moses, I your father in law Jethro am come to you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.\n",
      "And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.\n",
      "And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come on them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\n",
      "And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.\n",
      "And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.\n",
      "And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning to even?\n",
      "And Moses said to his father in law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:\n",
      "When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.\n",
      "And Moses' father in law said to him, The thing that you do is not good.\n",
      "You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.\n",
      "Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people to God-ward, that you may bring the causes to God:\n",
      "And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.\n",
      "Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\n",
      "And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.\n",
      "If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.\n",
      "So Moses listened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.\n",
      "And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n",
      "And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n",
      "And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.\n",
      "In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.\n",
      "For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.\n",
      "And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;\n",
      "You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.\n",
      "Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:\n",
      "And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.  These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\n",
      "And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever.  And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,\n",
      "And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai.\n",
      "And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:\n",
      "There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.\n",
      "And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n",
      "And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.\n",
      "And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\n",
      "And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\n",
      "And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.\n",
      "And the LORD came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\n",
      "And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.\n",
      "So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.\n",
      "And God spoke all these words, saying,\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n",
      "You shall have no other gods before me.\n",
      "You shall not make to you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\n",
      "You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;\n",
      "And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\n",
      "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.\n",
      "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n",
      "Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:\n",
      "But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:\n",
      "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: why the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n",
      "Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.\n",
      "You shall not kill.\n",
      "You shall not commit adultery.\n",
      "You shall not steal.\n",
      "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n",
      "You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.\n",
      "And all the people saw the thunder, and the lightning, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\n",
      "And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.\n",
      "And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that you sin not.\n",
      "And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.\n",
      "You shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.\n",
      "An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.\n",
      "And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.\n",
      "Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not discovered thereon.\n",
      "Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them.\n",
      "If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.\n",
      "If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.\n",
      "If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.\n",
      "And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:\n",
      "Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.\n",
      "And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.\n",
      "If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.\n",
      "And if he have betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.\n",
      "If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.\n",
      "And if he do not these three to her, then shall she go out free without money.\n",

      "And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother for glory and for beauty.\n",
      "And you shall speak to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.\n",
      "And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.\n",
      "It shall have the two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.\n",
      "And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.\n",
      "And you shall take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:\n",
      "Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.\n",
      "With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shall you engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: you shall make them to be set in ouches of gold.\n",
      "And you shall put the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial to the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for a memorial.\n",
      "And you shall make ouches of gold;\n",
      "And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shall you make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.\n",
      "And you shall make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod you shall make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shall you make it.\n",
      "Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.\n",
      "And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.\n",
      "And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.\n",
      "And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.\n",
      "And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their settings.\n",
      "And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.\n",
      "And you shall make on the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold.\n",
      "And you shall make on the breastplate two rings of gold, and shall put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.\n",
      "And you shall put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.\n",
      "And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains you shall fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod before it.\n",
      "And you shall make two rings of gold, and you shall put them on the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward.\n",
      "And two other rings of gold you shall make, and shall put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.\n",
      "And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.\n",
      "And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment on his heart, when he goes in to the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.\n",

      "And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.\n",
      "And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the middle thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.\n",
      "And beneath on the hem of it you shall make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:\n",
      "A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe round about.\n",
      "And it shall be on Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.\n",
      "And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\n",
      "And you shall put it on a blue lace, that it may be on the turban; on the forefront of the turban it shall be.\n",
      "And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.\n",
      "And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.\n",
      "And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:\n",
      "And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.\n",
      "And this is the thing that you shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,\n",
      "And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.\n",
      "And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.\n",
      "And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.\n",
      "And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:\n",
      "And you shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban.\n",
      "Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.\n",
      "And you shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.\n",
      "And you shall gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.\n",
      "And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.\n",
      "And you shall kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And you shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.\n",
      "And you shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.\n",
      "But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shall you burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.\n",
      "You shall also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram.\n",
      "And you shall slay the ram, and you shall take his blood, and sprinkle it round about on the altar.\n",
      "And you shall cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them to his pieces, and to his head.\n",
      "And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram.\n",
      "Then shall you kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.\n",
      "And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.\n",
      "Also you shall take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:\n",
      "And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:\n",
      "And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall receive them of their hands, and burn them on the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be your part.\n",
      "And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:\n",
      "And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.\n",
      "And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.\n",
      "And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.\n",
      "And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.\n",
      "And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n",
      "And thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.\n",
      "And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.\n",
      "Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.\n",
      "Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.\n",
      "The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:\n",
      "And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.\n",
      "And the other lamb you shall offer at even, and shall do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.\n",
      "And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.\n",
      "And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.\n",
      "And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.\n",
      "And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.\n",
      "A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.\n",
      "And you shall overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and you shall make to it a crown of gold round about.\n",
      "And two golden rings shall you make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, on the two sides of it shall you make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it with.\n",
      "And you shall make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.\n",
      "And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.\n",
      "And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.\n",
      "And when Aaron lights the lamps at even, he shall burn incense on it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.\n",
      "You shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall you pour drink offering thereon.\n",
      "And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.\n",
      "This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.\n",
      "Every one that passes among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.\n",
      "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering to the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n",
      "And you shall take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial to the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "You shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and you shall put water therein.\n",
      "For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:\n",
      "When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire to the LORD:\n",
      "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.\n",
      "Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,\n",
      "And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:\n",
      "And you shall make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the are of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.\n",
      "And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,\n",
      "And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,\n",
      "And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.\n",
      "And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.\n",
      "And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.\n",
      "On man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall you make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.\n",
      "Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Take to you sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:\n",
      "And you shall make it a perfume, a confection after the are of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:\n",
      "And you shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with you: it shall be to you most holy.\n",
      "And as for the perfume which you shall make, you shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be to you holy for the LORD.\n",
      "Whoever shall make like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\n",
      "And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,\n",
      "To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,\n",
      "And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\n",
      "And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you;\n",
      "The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,\n",
      "And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,\n",
      "And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,\n",
      "And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,\n",
      "And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you shall they do.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.\n",
      "You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n",
      "Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Why the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.\n",
      "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\n",
      "And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.\n",
      "And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.\n",
      "And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.\n",
      "And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.\n",
      "And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.\n",
      "And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:\n",
      "They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:\n",
      "Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.\n",
      "And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\n",
      "Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.\n",
      "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\n",
      "And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.\n",
      "And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n",
      "And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.\n",
      "And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\n",
      "And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.\n",
      "And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?\n",
      "And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are set on mischief.\n",
      "For they said to me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.\n",
      "And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\n",
      "And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)\n",
      "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.\n",
      "And he said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.\n",
      "And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n",
      "For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man on his son, and on his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\n",
      "And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\n",
      "Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.\n",
      "Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.\n",
      "And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:\n",
      "And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\n",
      "To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.\n",
      "And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.\n",
      "For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.\n",
      "And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.\n",
      "And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.\n",
      "And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, See, you say to me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.\n",
      "And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.\n",
      "And he said to him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.\n",
      "For wherein shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.\n",
      "And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.\n",
      "And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.\n",
      "And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:\n",
      "And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first: and I will write on these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you brake.\n",
      "And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me in the top of the mount.\n",
      "And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.\n",
      "And he hewed two tables of stone like to the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n",
      "And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\n",
      "Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.\n",
      "And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.\n",
      "And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.\n",
      "And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.\n",
      "Observe you that which I command you this day: behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n",
      "Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:\n",
      "But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:\n",
      "For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n",
      "Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;\n",
      "And you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.\n",
      "You shall make you no molten gods.\n",
      "The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.\n",
      "All that opens the matrix is mine; and every firstling among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\n",
      "But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n",
      "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ripening time and in harvest you shall rest.\n",
      "And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.\n",
      "Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.\n",
      "For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God thrice in the year.\n",
      "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left to the morning.\n",
      "The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\n",
      "And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.\n",
      "And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.\n",
      "And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses talked with them.\n",
      "And afterward all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.\n",
      "And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.\n",
      "But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.\n",
      "And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.\n",
      "And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD has commanded, that you should do them.\n",
      "Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.\n",
      "You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the sabbath day.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,\n",
      "Take you from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,\n",
      "And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,\n",
      "And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,\n",
      "And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,\n",
      "And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.\n",
      "And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD has commanded;\n",
      "The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his clasps, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,\n",
      "The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering,\n",
      "The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the show bread,\n",
      "The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,\n",
      "And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,\n",
      "The altar of burnt offering, with his brazen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,\n",
      "The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,\n",
      "The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,\n",
      "The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.\n",
      "And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.\n",
      "And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.\n",
      "And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold to the LORD.\n",
      "And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.\n",
      "Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.\n",
      "And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.\n",
      "And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.\n",
      "And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;\n",
      "And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.\n",
      "The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD has called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;\n",
      "And he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;\n",
      "And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,\n",
      "And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\n",
      "And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n",
      "Them has he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.\n",
      "Then worked Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.\n",
      "And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it:\n",
      "And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it with. And they brought yet to him free offerings every morning.\n",
      "And all the wise men, that worked all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;\n",
      "And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\n",
      "And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.\n",
      "For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.\n",
      "And every wise hearted man among them that worked the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work made he them.\n",
      "The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\n",
      "And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.\n",
      "And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.\n",
      "Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.\n",
      "And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so it became one tabernacle.\n",
      "And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\n",
      "The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\n",
      "And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.\n",
      "And he made fifty loops on the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain which couples the second.\n",
      "And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.\n",
      "And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.\n",
      "And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.\n",
      "The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.\n",
      "One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:\n",
      "And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.\n",
      "And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,\n",
      "And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.\n",
      "And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.\n",
      "And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.\n",
      "And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.\n",
      "And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.\n",
      "And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,\n",
      "And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.\n",
      "And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.\n",
      "And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\n",
      "And he made a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim made he it of cunning work.\n",
      "And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.\n",
      "And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;\n",
      "And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.\n",
      "And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.\n",
      "And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.\n",
      "And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.\n",
      "And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.\n",
      "And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.\n",
      "And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;\n",
      "One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on the two ends thereof.\n",
      "And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.\n",
      "And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.\n",
      "Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.\n",
      "And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.\n",
      "Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.\n",
      "And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.\n",
      "And he made the vessels which were on the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover with, of pure gold.\n",
      "And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:\n",
      "And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:\n",
      "Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a bud and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a bud and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.\n",
      "And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:\n",
      "And a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.\n",
      "Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.\n",
      "And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his firepans, of pure gold.\n",
      "Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.\n",
      "And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.\n",
      "And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made to it a crown of gold round about.\n",
      "And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, on the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it with.\n",
      "And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.\n",

      "And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.\n",
      "And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were enclosed in ouches of gold in their settings.\n",
      "And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.\n",
      "And they made on the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.\n",
      "And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.\n",
      "And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.\n",
      "And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, before it.\n",
      "And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.\n",
      "And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.\n",
      "And they did bind the breastplate by his rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.\n",
      "And there was an hole in the middle of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.\n",
      "And they made on the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.\n",
      "And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;\n",
      "A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,\n",
      "And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,\n",
      "And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\n",
      "And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high on the turban; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.\n",
      "And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his clasps, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,\n",
      "And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the veil of the covering,\n",
      "The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,\n",
      "The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the show bread,\n",
      "The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,\n",
      "And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,\n",
      "The brazen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,\n",
      "The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,\n",
      "The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.\n",
      "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.\n",
      "And Moses did look on all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\n",
      "And you shall put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil.\n",
      "And you shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.\n",
      "And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.\n",
      "And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\n",
      "And you shall set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shall put water therein.\n",
      "And you shall set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.\n",
      "And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.\n",
      "And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.\n",
      "And you shall anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.\n",
      "And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.\n",
      "And you shall put on Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest's office.\n",
      "And you shall bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:\n",
      "And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.\n",
      "Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\n",
      "And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.\n",
      "And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark:\n",
      "And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, on the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.\n",
      "And he set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\n",
      "And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:\n",
      "And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:\n",
      "When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.\n",
      "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n",
      "And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud stayed thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.\n",
      "And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:\n",
      "But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.\n",
      "For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.\n",
      "And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you bring an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.\n",
      "If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n",
      "And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n",
      "And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\n",
      "And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire:\n",
      "And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:\n",
      "But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.\n",
      "And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.\n",
      "And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:\n",
      "But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.\n",
      "And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:\n",
      "And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:\n",
      "And he shall split it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:\n",
      "And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:\n",
      "And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "And if you bring an oblation of a meat offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.\n",
      "And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n",
      "You shall part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.\n",
      "And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in the frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.\n",
      "And you shall bring the meat offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.\n",
      "And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it on the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "No meat offering, which you shall bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.\n",
      "As for the oblation of the first fruits, you shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet smell.\n",
      "And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.\n",
      "And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\n",
      "And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.\n",
      "And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.\n",
      "And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,\n",
      "And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the lobe above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.\n",

      "It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:\n",
      "If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.\n",
      "And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand on the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\n",

      "And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,\n",
      "Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\n",
      "And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;\n",
      "When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",

      "The fire shall ever be burning on the altar; it shall never go out.\n",
      "And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.\n",
      "And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is on the meat offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell, even the memorial of it, to the LORD.\n",
      "And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\n",
      "It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.\n",
      "All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.\n",
      "In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever to the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.\n",
      "For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.\n",
      "The priest that offers it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "Whatever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof on any garment, you shall wash that where on it was sprinkled in the holy place.\n",
      "But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.\n",
      "All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.\n",
      "And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile with in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\n",
      "Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.\n",
      "In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about on the altar.\n",
      "And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covers the inwards,\n",
      "And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the lobe that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:\n",
      "And the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a trespass offering.\n",
      "Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.\n",
      "As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that makes atonement therewith shall have it.\n",
      "And the priest that offers any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.\n",
      "And all the meat offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offers it.\n",
      "And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\n",
      "And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD.\n",
      "If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.\n",
      "Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.\n",
      "And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering to the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.\n",
      "And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.\n",
      "But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:\n",
      "But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.\n",
      "And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him that offers it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.\n",
      "And the flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.\n",
      "But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n",
      "Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.\n",
      "And the fat of the beast that dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but you shall in no wise eat of it.\n",
      "For whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people.\n",
      "Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.\n",
      "Whatever soul it be that eats any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his oblation to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\n",
      "His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.\n",
      "And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.\n",
      "And the right shoulder shall you give to the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\n",
      "He among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.\n",
      "For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.\n",
      "This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office;\n",
      "Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.\n",
      "This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;\n",
      "Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;\n",
      "And gather you all the congregation together to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.\n",
      "And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\n",
      "And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.\n",
      "And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.\n",
      "And he put the turban on his head; also on the turban, even on his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.\n",
      "And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.\n",
      "And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.\n",
      "And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats on them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets on them; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering.\n",
      "And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.\n",
      "And he took all the fat that was on the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it on the altar.\n",
      "But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.\n",
      "And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.\n",
      "And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.\n",
      "And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram on the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet smell, and an offering made by fire to the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.\n",
      "And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.\n",
      "And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.\n",
      "And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:\n",
      "And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and on the right shoulder:\n",
      "And he put all on Aaron's hands, and on his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet smell: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.\n",
      "And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread shall you burn with fire.\n",
      "And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.\n",
      "As he has done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.\n",
      "Therefore shall you abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that you die not: for so I am commanded.\n",
      "So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;\n",
      "And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.\n",
      "And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take you a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;\n",
      "Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear to you.\n",
      "And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\n",
      "Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.\n",
      "And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:\n",
      "But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt on the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\n",
      "And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled round about on the altar.\n",
      "And they presented the burnt offering to him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them on the altar.\n",
      "And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt offering on the altar.\n",
      "And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.\n",
      "And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.\n",
      "And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it on the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.\n",
      "He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,\n",
      "And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver:\n",
      "And they put the fat on the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar:\n",
      "And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\n",
      "And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.\n",
      "And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n",
      "And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.\n",
      "And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.\n",
      "Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.\n",
      "And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.\n",
      "So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.\n",
      "And you shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is on you. And they did according to the word of Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:\n",
      "And that you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;\n",
      "And that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remains of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:\n",
      "And you shall eat it in the holy place, because it is your due, and your sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\n",
      "And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they be your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.\n",
      "The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, by a statute for ever; as the LORD has commanded.\n",
      "And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,\n",
      "Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?\n",
      "Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: you should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\n",
      "And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?\n",
      "And when Moses heard that, he was content.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which you shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n",
      "Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that shall you eat.\n",
      "Nevertheless these shall you not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.\n",
      "And the coney, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.\n",
      "And the hare, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.\n",
      "And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he chews not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n",
      "Of their flesh shall you not eat, and their carcass shall you not touch; they are unclean to you.\n",
      "These shall you eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall you eat.\n",
      "And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination to you:\n",
      "They shall be even an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination.\n",
      "Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination to you.\n",
      "And these are they which you shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,\n",
      "And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;\n",
      "Every raven after his kind;\n",
      "And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,\n",
      "And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,\n",
      "And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,\n",
      "And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n",
      "All fowls that creep, going on all four, shall be an abomination to you.\n",
      "Yet these may you eat of every flying creeping thing that goes on all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap with on the earth;\n",
      "Even these of them you may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n",
      "But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination to you.\n",
      "And for these you shall be unclean: whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n",
      "The carcasses of every beast which divides the hoof, and is not cloven footed, nor chews the cud, are unclean to you: every one that touches them shall be unclean.\n",
      "And whatever goes on his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean to you: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.\n",
      "These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,\n",
      "And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.\n",
      "These are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever does touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And on whatever any of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.\n",
      "And every earthen vessel, into where any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean; and you shall break it.\n",
      "Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water comes shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.\n",
      "And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean to you.\n",
      "Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.\n",
      "And if any part of their carcass fall on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.\n",
      "But if any water be put on the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean to you.\n",
      "And if any beast, of which you may eat, die; he that touches the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.\n",
      "Whatever goes on the belly, and whatever goes on all four, or whatever has more feet among all creeping things that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are an abomination.\n",
      "You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled thereby.\n",
      "For I am the LORD your God: you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\n",
      "For I am the LORD that brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.\n",
      "This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth:\n",
      "To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.\n",
      "And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\n",
      "And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.\n",
      "But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and six days.\n",
      "And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:\n",
      "Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that has born a male or a female.\n",
      "And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,\n",
      "When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:\n",

      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.\n",
      "You shall do no servile work therein: but you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.\n",
      "For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.\n",
      "And whatever soul it be that does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.\n",
      "You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n",
      "It shall be to you a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even, shall you celebrate your sabbath.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.\n",
      "On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.\n",
      "Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.\n",
      "These are the feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing on his day:\n",
      "Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.\n",
      "Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.\n",
      "And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.\n",
      "And you shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.\n",
      "You shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:\n",
      "That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "And Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.\n",
      "Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening to the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.\n",
      "He shall order the lamps on the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.\n",
      "And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.\n",
      "And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD.\n",
      "And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.\n",
      "Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.\n",
      "And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;\n",
      "And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)\n",
      "And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be showed them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Bring forth him that has cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.\n",
      "And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.\n",
      "And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.\n",
      "And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And he that kills a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.\n",
      "And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;\n",
      "Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.\n",
      "And he that kills a beast, he shall restore it: and he that kills a man, he shall be put to death.\n",
      "You shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.\n",
      "Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;\n",
      "But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.\n",
      "That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, neither gather the grapes of your vine undressed: for it is a year of rest to the land.\n",
      "And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojournes with you.\n",
      "And for your cattle, and for the beast that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.\n",
      "And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.\n",
      "Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.\n",
      "And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.\n",
      "A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.\n",
      "For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.\n",
      "In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.\n",
      "And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:\n",
      "According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:\n",
      "According to the multitude of years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years you shall diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits does he sell to you.\n",
      "You shall not therefore oppress one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "Why you shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.\n",
      "And the land shall yield her fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.\n",
      "And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:\n",
      "Then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.\n",
      "And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you shall eat of the old store.\n",
      "The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.\n",
      "And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.\n",
      "If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.\n",
      "And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;\n",
      "Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.\n",
      "But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.\n",
      "And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.\n",
      "And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.\n",
      "But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.\n",
      "And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.\n",
      "But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.\n",
      "And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.\n",
      "Take you no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.\n",
      "You shall not give him your money on usury, nor lend him your victuals for increase.\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\n",
      "And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:\n",
      "But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you, and shall serve you to the year of jubilee.\n",
      "And then shall he depart from you, both he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.\n",
      "For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as slaves.\n",
      "You shall not rule over him with rigor; but shall fear your God.\n",
      "Both your slaves, and your bondmaids, which you shall have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall you buy slaves and bondmaids.\n",
      "Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.\n",
      "And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your slaves for ever: but over your brothers the children of Israel, you shall not rule one over another with rigor.\n",
      "And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by you, and your brother that dwells by him wax poor, and sell himself to the stranger or sojourner by you, or to the stock of the stranger's family:\n",
      "After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brothers may redeem him:\n",
      "Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.\n",
      "And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.\n",
      "If there be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.\n",
      "And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.\n",
      "And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.\n",
      "And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.\n",
      "For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "You shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.\n",
      "If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;\n",
      "Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.\n",
      "And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time: and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.\n",
      "And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.\n",
      "And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.\n",
      "And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.\n",
      "For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\n",
      "And you shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.\n",
      "And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.\n",
      "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\n",
      "But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;\n",
      "And if you shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that you will not do all my commandments, but that you break my covenant:\n",
      "I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.\n",
      "And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.\n",
      "And if you will not yet for all this listen to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.\n",
      "And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:\n",
      "And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\n",
      "And if you walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me; I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.\n",
      "I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.\n",
      "And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;\n",
      "Then will I also walk contrary to you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.\n",
      "And I will bring a sword on you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.\n",
      "And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.\n",
      "And if you will not for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;\n",
      "Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.\n",
      "And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.\n",
      "And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.\n",
      "And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the smell of your sweet odors.\n",
      "And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.\n",
      "And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.\n",
      "Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.\n",
      "As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelled on it.\n",
      "And on them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.\n",
      "And they shall fall one on another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.\n",
      "And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.\n",
      "And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.\n",
      "If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;\n",
      "And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:\n",
      "Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.\n",
      "The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.\n",
      "And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.\n",
      "But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.\n",
      "These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.\n",
      "And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.\n",
      "And if it be a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels.\n",
      "And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.\n",
      "And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver.\n",
      "And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.\n",
      "But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.\n",
      "And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.\n",
      "He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.\n",
      "And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:\n",
      "And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.\n",
      "But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof to your estimation.\n",
      "And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.\n",
      "And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.\n",
      "And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.\n",
      "If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.\n",
      "But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from your estimation.\n",
      "And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.\n",
      "And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.\n",
      "But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.\n",
      "And if a man sanctify to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;\n",
      "Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD.\n",
      "In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.\n",
      "And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.\n",
      "Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.\n",
      "And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.\n",
      "Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.\n",
      "None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD.\n",
      "And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.\n",
      "And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.\n",
      "He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.\n",
      "These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.\n",

      "From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.\n",
      "And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.\n",
      "And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n",
      "Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n",

      "Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan.\n",
      "These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names:\n",
      "And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.\n",

      "All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall come at no dead body.\n",
      "He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.\n",
      "All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.\n",
      "And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.\n",
      "And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:\n",
      "And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.\n",
      "And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.\n",
      "And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:\n",
      "And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,\n",
      "And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.\n",
      "And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:\n",
      "And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.\n",
      "And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.\n",
      "And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:\n",
      "And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.\n",
      "This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed, and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.\n",

      "And it shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to you.\n",
      "And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.\n",
      "And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.\n",
      "And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.\n",
      "And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.\n",
      "And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.\n",
      "And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.\n",
      "And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?\n",
      "We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:\n",
      "But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.\n",
      "And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.\n",
      "And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.\n",
      "And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.\n",
      "Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, Why have you afflicted your servant? and why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?\n",
      "Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?\n",
      "From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.\n",
      "I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.\n",
      "And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.\n",
      "And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.\n",
      "And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and you shall eat flesh: for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.\n",
      "You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;\n",
      "But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you: because that you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?\n",
      "And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.\n",
      "Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? you shall see now whether my word shall come to pass to you or not.\n",
      "And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.\n",
      "And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.\n",
      "But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.\n",
      "And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.\n",
      "And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!\n",
      "And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high on the face of the earth.\n",
      "And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.\n",
      "And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.\n",
      "And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.\n",
      "And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and stayed at Hazeroth.\n",
      "And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.\n",
      "And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? has he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.\n",
      "(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.)\n",
      "And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.\n",
      "And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.\n",
      "And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.\n",
      "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.\n",
      "With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.\n",
      "And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.\n",
      "And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech you, lay not the sin on us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.\n",
      "Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.\n",
      "And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech you.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.\n",
      "And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.\n",
      "And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a ruler among them.\n",
      "And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n",
      "These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.  And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.\n",
      "And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:\n",
      "And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;\n",
      "And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;\n",
      "And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be you of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.\n",
      "So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.\n",
      "And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n",
      "And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two on a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.\n",
      "The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from there.\n",
      "And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.\n",
      "And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.\n",
      "And they told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.\n",
      "Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.\n",
      "The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.\n",
      "And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\n",
      "But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.\n",
      "And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.\n",
      "And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\n",
      "And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.\n",
      "And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!\n",
      "And why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?\n",
      "And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.\n",
      "Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:\n",
      "And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.\n",
      "If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.\n",
      "Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.\n",
      "But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?\n",
      "I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.\n",
      "And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)\n",
      "And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.\n",
      "Now if you shall kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,\n",
      "Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.\n",
      "And now, I beseech you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,\n",
      "The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.\n",
      "Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word:\n",
      "But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.\n",
      "Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;\n",
      "Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:\n",
      "But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into where he went; and his seed shall possess it.\n",
      "(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelled in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.\n",
      "Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:\n",
      "Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.\n",
      "Doubtless you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised.\n",
      "But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.\n",
      "And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.\n",
      "After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.\n",
      "I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.\n",
      "And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander on the land,\n",
      "Even those men that did bring up the evil report on the land, died by the plague before the LORD.\n",
      "But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.\n",
      "And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.\n",
      "And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, See, we be here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned.\n",
      "And Moses said, Why now do you transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.\n",
      "Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that you be not smitten before your enemies.\n",
      "For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.\n",
      "But they presumed to go up to the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.\n",
      "Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,\n",
      "And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet smell to the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:\n",
      "Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.\n",
      "And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shall you prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.\n",
      "Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.\n",
      "And for a drink offering you shall offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And when you prepare a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings to the LORD:\n",
      "Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.\n",
      "And you shall bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.\n",
      "According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you do to every one according to their number.\n",
      "All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.\n",
      "One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojournes with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.\n",
      "One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land where I bring you,\n",
      "Then it shall be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up an heave offering to the LORD.\n",
      "You shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as you do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you heave it.\n",
      "Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an heave offering in your generations.\n",
      "And if you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,\n",
      "Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;\n",
      "Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell to the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:\n",
      "And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojournes among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.\n",
      "And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.\n",
      "And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.\n",
      "You shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them.\n",
      "But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n",
      "Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.\n",
      "And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.\n",
      "And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.\n",
      "And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.\n",
      "And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:\n",
      "And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to go a whoring:\n",
      "That you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.\n",
      "Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:\n",
      "And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:\n",
      "And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?\n",
      "And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face:\n",
      "And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.\n",
      "This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;\n",
      "And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.\n",
      "And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, you sons of Levi:\n",
      "Seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?\n",
      "And he has brought you near to him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you: and seek you the priesthood also?\n",
      "For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that you murmur against him?\n",
      "And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:\n",
      "Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you make yourself altogether a prince over us?\n",
      "Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.\n",
      "And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.\n",
      "And Moses said to Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:\n",
      "And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.\n",
      "And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.\n",
      "And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be wroth with all the congregation?\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\n",
      "And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.\n",
      "And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest you be consumed in all their sins.\n",
      "So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.\n",
      "And Moses said, Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of my own mind.\n",
      "If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD has not sent me.\n",
      "But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them:\n",
      "And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.\n",
      "They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed on them: and they perished from among the congregation.\n",
      "And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.\n",
      "And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.\n",
      "The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:\n",
      "To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell on their faces.\n",
      "And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.\n",
      "And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the middle of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.\n",
      "And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.\n",
      "Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.\n",
      "And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write you every man's name on his rod.\n",
      "And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.\n",
      "And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.\n",
      "And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.\n",
      "And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.\n",
      "And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.\n",
      "And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n",
      "And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.\n",
      "Whoever comes any thing near to the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.\n",
      "And your brothers also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.\n",
      "And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor you also, die.\n",
      "And they shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come near to you.\n",
      "And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more on the children of Israel.\n",
      "And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.\n",
      "This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.\n",
      "In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to you.\n",
      "And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.\n",
      "All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.\n",
      "And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.\n",
      "Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.\n",
      "Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.\n",
      "And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.\n",
      "But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the LORD.\n",
      "And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.\n",
      "All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.\n",
      "And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "Neither must the children of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.\n",
      "But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.\n",
      "But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.\n",
      "And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.\n",
      "Thus you also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and you shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.\n",
      "Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.\n",
      "Therefore you shall say to them, When you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.\n",
      "And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n",
      "This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and on which never came yoke:\n",
      "And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:\n",
      "And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:\n",
      "And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:\n",
      "And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.\n",
      "Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And he that burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.\n",
      "And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.\n",
      "And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojournes among them, for a statute for ever.\n",
      "He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.\n",
      "Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.\n",
      "This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "And every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.\n",
      "And whoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.\n",
      "And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:\n",
      "And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons that were there, and on him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:\n",
      "And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.\n",
      "But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.\n",
      "And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until even.\n",
      "And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.\n",
      "Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.\n",
      "And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.\n",
      "And the people strived with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brothers died before the LORD!\n",
      "And why have you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?\n",
      "And why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell on their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Take the rod, and gather you the assembly together, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so you shall give the congregation and their beasts drink.\n",
      "And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.\n",
      "And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?\n",
      "And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.\n",
      "This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.\n",
      "And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:\n",
      "How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelled in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:\n",
      "And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border:\n",
      "Let us pass, I pray you, through your country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your borders.\n",
      "And Edom said to him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of your water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.\n",
      "And he said, You shall not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.\n",
      "Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away from him.\n",
      "And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,\n",
      "Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.\n",
      "Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:\n",
      "And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.\n",
      "And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.\n",
      "And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.\n",
      "And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\n",
      "And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.\n",
      "And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.\n",
      "And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.\n",
      "And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.\n",
      "And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.\n",
      "And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.\n",
      "Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks on it, shall live.\n",
      "And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it on a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.\n",
      "And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.\n",
      "And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rise.\n",
      "From there they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.\n",
      "From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.\n",
      "Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,\n",
      "And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.\n",
      "And from there they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.\n",
      "Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:\n",
      "The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:\n",
      "And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:\n",
      "And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.\n",
      "And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,\n",
      "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past your borders.\n",
      "And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.\n",
      "And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.\n",
      "And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.\n",
      "For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.\n",
      "Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:\n",
      "For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.\n",
      "Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.\n",
      "We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.\n",
      "Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.\n",
      "And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.\n",
      "And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.\n",
      "So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.\n",
      "And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.\n",
      "And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.\n",
      "And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.  And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.\n",
      "He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:\n",
      "Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.\n",
      "And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.\n",
      "And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.\n",
      "And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?\n",
      "And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,\n",
      "Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.\n",
      "And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people: for they are blessed.\n",
      "And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.\n",
      "And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.\n",
      "And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.\n",
      "And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus said Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me:\n",
      "For I will promote you to very great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me: come therefore, I pray you, curse me this people.\n",
      "And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.\n",
      "And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.\n",
      "And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.\n",
      "And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.\n",
      "And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\n",
      "And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.\n",
      "And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have smitten me these three times?\n",
      "And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.\n",
      "And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I your ass, on which you have ridden ever since I was your to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? And he said, No.\n",
      "Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:\n",
      "And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.\n",
      "And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.\n",
      "And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? why came you not to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, See, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.\n",
      "And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth.\n",
      "And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.\n",
      "And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.\n",
      "And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.\n",
      "And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.\n",
      "And he returned to him, and, see, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.\n",
      "How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD has not defied?\n",
      "For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: see, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\n",
      "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.\n",
      "And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?\n",
      "And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.\n",
      "And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.\n",
      "And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.\n",
      "And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has the LORD spoken?\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:\n",
      "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?\n",
      "Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.\n",
      "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.\n",
      "God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.\n",
      "Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!\n",
      "Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.\n",
      "But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Told not I you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?\n",
      "And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray you, I will bring you to another place; peradventure it will please God that you may curse me them from there.\n",
      "And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.\n",
      "And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.\n",
      "And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came on him.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:\n",
      "He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:\n",
      "How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!\n",
      "As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD has planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.\n",
      "He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.\n",
      "God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.\n",
      "He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesses you, and cursed is he that curses you.\n",
      "And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.\n",
      "Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, see, the LORD has kept you back from honor.\n",
      "And Balaam said to Balak, Spoke I not also to your messengers which you sent to me, saying,\n",
      "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD said, that will I speak?\n",
      "And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:\n",
      "He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:\n",
      "I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.\n",
      "And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.\n",
      "Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remains of the city.\n",
      "And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.\n",
      "And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.\n",
      "Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.\n",
      "And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this!\n",
      "And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.\n",
      "And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.\n",
      "And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab.\n",
      "And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.\n",
      "And Israel joined himself to Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.\n",
      "And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay you every one his men that were joined to Baalpeor.\n",
      "And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;\n",
      "And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.\n",
      "And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.\n",
      "Why say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:\n",
      "And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.\n",
      "Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.\n",
      "And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Vex the Midianites, and smite them:\n",
      "For they vex you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.\n",
      "And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,\n",
      "Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.\n",
      "And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,\n",
      "Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.\n",

      "Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.\n",
      "And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.\n",

      "Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.\n",
      "And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,\n",
      "And three score and twelve thousand beeves,\n",
      "And three score and one thousand asses,\n",
      "And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.\n",
      "And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:\n",

      "And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,\n",
      "(Now the half that pertained to the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,\n",

      "And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:\n",
      "And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.\n",
      "We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.\n",
      "And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.\n",
      "And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.\n",
      "(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)\n",
      "And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.\n",
      "Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;\n",
      "The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,\n",
      "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,\n",
      "Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle:\n",
      "Why, said they, if we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.\n",
      "And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?\n",
      "And why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?\n",
      "Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.\n",
      "For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.\n",
      "And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,\n",
      "Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:\n",
      "Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.\n",
      "And, behold, you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.\n",
      "For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.\n",
      "And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:\n",
      "But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.\n",
      "We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.\n",
      "For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.\n",
      "And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,\n",
      "And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,\n",
      "And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.\n",
      "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.\n",
      "Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.\n",
      "And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.\n",
      "Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:\n",
      "But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord said.\n",
      "So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:\n",
      "But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said to your servants, so will we do.\n",
      "We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.\n",
      "And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.\n",
      "And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,\n",

      "And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.\n",
      "And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.\n",
      "And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.\n",
      "And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.\n",
      "And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.\n",
      "These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.\n",

      "And you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.\n",
      "And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.\n",
      "But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.\n",
      "Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Command the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)\n",
      "Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:\n",
      "And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:\n",
      "And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.\n",
      "And as for the western border, you shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.\n",
      "And this shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall point out for you mount Hor:\n",
      "From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:\n",
      "And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.\n",
      "And you shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:\n",
      "And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:\n",
      "And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.\n",
      "And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:\n",
      "For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:\n",
      "The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sun rise.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "These are the names of the men which shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "And you shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.\n",
      "And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\n",
      "And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.\n",
      "The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.\n",
      "And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.\n",
      "These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,\n",
      "Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.\n",
      "And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.\n",
      "And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.\n",
      "And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.\n",
      "And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which you shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them you shall add forty and two cities.\n",
      "So all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall you give with their suburbs.\n",
      "And the cities which you shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many you shall give many; but from them that have few you shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;\n",
      "Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which kills any person at unawares.\n",
      "And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.\n",
      "And of these cities which you shall give six cities shall you have for refuge.\n",
      "You shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall you give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.\n",
      "These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that kills any person unawares may flee thither.\n",
      "And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And if he smite him with throwing a stone, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.\n",
      "But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;\n",
      "Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meets him.\n",
      "But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,\n",
      "Or with any stone, with which a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it on him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:\n",
      "Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:\n",
      "And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.\n",
      "But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, where he was fled;\n",
      "And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:\n",
      "Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.\n",
      "So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n",
      "Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.\n",
      "Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.\n",
      "And you shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.\n",
      "So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\n",
      "Defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:\n",
      "And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.\n",
      "And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.\n",
      "And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.\n",
      "And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.\n",
      "This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.\n",
      "So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.\n",
      "And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.\n",
      "Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.\n",
      "Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:\n",
      "For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons:\n",
      "And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.\n",
      "These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.\n",
      "These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.\n",
      "(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)\n",
      "And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;\n",
      "After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelled in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelled at Astaroth in Edrei:\n",
      "On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,\n",
      "The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:\n",
      "Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places near thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.\n",
      "Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.\n",
      "And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:\n",
      "The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.\n",
      "(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)\n",
      "How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?\n",
      "Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\n",
      "And you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.\n",
      "So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.\n",
      "And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.\n",
      "You shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.\n",
      "And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.\n",
      "And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.\n",
      "And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.\n",
      "Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said to you; fear not, neither be discouraged.\n",
      "And you came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.\n",
      "And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:\n",
      "And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.\n",
      "And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.\n",
      "Notwithstanding you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:\n",
      "And you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.\n",
      "Where shall we go up? our brothers have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.\n",
      "Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.\n",
      "The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;\n",
      "And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.\n",
      "Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,\n",
      "Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.\n",
      "And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,\n",
      "Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers.\n",
      "Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.\n",
      "Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.\n",
      "But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\n",
      "Moreover your little ones, which you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.\n",
      "But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.\n",
      "Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.  And when you had girded on every man his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the hill.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Say to them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be smitten before your enemies.\n",
      "So I spoke to you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.\n",
      "And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.\n",
      "And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not listen to your voice, nor give ear to you.\n",
      "So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed there.\n",
      "Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to me, saying,\n",
      "You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.\n",
      "And command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the coast of your brothers the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed to yourselves therefore:\n",
      "Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.\n",
      "You shall buy meat of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.\n",
      "For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.\n",
      "And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.\n",
      "The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;\n",
      "Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.\n",
      "The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.\n",
      "Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.\n",
      "And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.\n",
      "For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.\n",
      "So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,\n",
      "That the LORD spoke to me, saying,\n",
      "You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:\n",
      "And when you come near over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.\n",
      "(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelled therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;\n",
      "A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead:\n",
      "As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:\n",
      "And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)\n",
      "Rise you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.\n",
      "This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.\n",
      "And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,\n",
      "Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.\n",
      "You shall sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;\n",
      "(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.\n",
      "But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.\n",
      "Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.\n",
      "And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.\n",
      "And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:\n",
      "Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.\n",
      "From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:\n",
      "Only to the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities in the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbade us.\n",
      "Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.\n",
      "So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.\n",
      "And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.\n",
      "And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.\n",
      "But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.\n",
      "And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;\n",
      "(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)\n",
      "All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.\n",
      "And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.\n",
      "And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.\n",
      "Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.\n",
      "And I gave Gilead to Machir.\n",
      "And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.\n",
      "And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.\n",
      "But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;\n",
      "Until the LORD have given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond Jordan: and then shall you return every man to his possession, which I have given you.\n",
      "And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms where you pass.\n",
      "You shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.\n",
      "And I sought the LORD at that time, saying,\n",
      "O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?\n",
      "I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.\n",
      "But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.\n",
      "Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.\n",
      "But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.\n",
      "So we stayed in the valley over against Bethpeor.\n",
      "Now therefore listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.\n",
      "You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.\n",
      "Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.\n",
      "But you that did join to the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.\n",
      "Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it.\n",
      "Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\n",
      "For what nation is there so great, who has God so near to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call on him for?\n",
      "And what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?\n",
      "Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;\n",
      "Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.\n",
      "And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.\n",
      "And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.\n",
      "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.\n",
      "Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:\n",
      "Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,\n",
      "The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,\n",
      "The likeness of any thing that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:\n",
      "And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.\n",
      "But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.\n",
      "Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:\n",
      "But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but you shall go over, and possess that good land.\n",
      "Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.\n",
      "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.\n",
      "When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.\n",
      "And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.\n",
      "And there you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\n",
      "But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.\n",
      "When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come on you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient to his voice;\n",
      "(For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.\n",
      "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?\n",
      "Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\n",
      "Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the middle of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\n",
      "To you it was showed, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.\n",
      "Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.\n",
      "And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;\n",
      "To drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.\n",
      "Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.\n",
      "You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.\n",
      "Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;\n",
      "That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:\n",
      "Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.\n",
      "And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:\n",
      "These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:\n",
      "And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;\n",
      "From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon,\n",
      "And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.\n",
      "And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.\n",
      "The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\n",
      "The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\n",
      "The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,\n",
      "(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,\n",
      "I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n",
      "You shall have none other gods before me.\n",
      "You shall not make you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:\n",
      "You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,\n",
      "And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.\n",
      "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.\n",
      "Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.\n",
      "Six days you shall labor, and do all your work:\n",
      "But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.\n",
      "And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out there through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.\n",
      "Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.\n",
      "You shall not kill.\n",
      "Neither shall you commit adultery.\n",
      "Neither shall you steal.\n",
      "Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.\n",
      "Neither shall you desire your neighbor's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is your neighbor's.\n",
      "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;\n",
      "And you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.\n",
      "Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.\n",
      "For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?\n",
      "Go you near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak you to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.\n",
      "And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.\n",
      "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!\n",
      "Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.\n",
      "But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.\n",
      "You shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.\n",
      "Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go to possess it:\n",
      "That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.\n",
      "Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.\n",
      "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:\n",
      "And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.\n",
      "And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in your heart:\n",
      "And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.\n",
      "And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.\n",
      "And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.\n",
      "And it shall be, when the LORD your God shall have brought you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities, which you built not,\n",
      "And houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and wells dig, which you digged not, vineyards and olive trees, which you planted not; when you shall have eaten and be full;\n",
      "Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n",
      "You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.\n",
      "You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;\n",
      "(For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.\n",
      "You shall not tempt the LORD your God, as you tempted him in Massah.\n",
      "You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.\n",
      "And you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to your fathers.\n",
      "To cast out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.\n",
      "And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God has commanded you?\n",
      "Then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:\n",
      "And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household, before our eyes:\n",
      "And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.\n",
      "And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.\n",
      "And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.\n",
      "When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;\n",
      "And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:\n",
      "Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.\n",
      "For they will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy you suddenly.\n",
      "But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.\n",
      "For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.\n",
      "The LORD did not set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people:\n",
      "But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n",
      "Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;\n",
      "And repays them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hates him, he will repay him to his face.\n",
      "You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.\n",
      "Why it shall come to pass, if you listen to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD your God shall keep to you the covenant and the mercy which he swore to your fathers:\n",
      "And he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you: he will also bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land, your corn, and your wine, and your oil, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.\n",
      "You shall be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.\n",
      "And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you; but will lay them on all them that hate you.\n",
      "And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; your eye shall have no pity on them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.\n",
      "If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?\n",
      "You shall not be afraid of them: but shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;\n",
      "The great temptations which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD your God brought you out: so shall the LORD your God do to all the people of whom you are afraid.\n",
      "Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from you, be destroyed.\n",
      "You shall not be affrighted at them: for the LORD your God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.\n",
      "And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase on you.\n",
      "But the LORD your God shall deliver them to you, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.\n",
      "And he shall deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.\n",
      "The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.\n",
      "Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.\n",
      "All the commandments which I command you this day shall you observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.\n",
      "And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.\n",
      "And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.\n",
      "Your raiment waxed not old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.\n",
      "You shall also consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.\n",
      "Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.\n",
      "For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;\n",
      "A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;\n",
      "A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig brass.\n",
      "When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.\n",
      "Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command you this day:\n",
      "Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelled therein;\n",
      "And when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;\n",
      "Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;\n",
      "Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;\n",
      "Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;\n",
      "And you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.\n",
      "But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.\n",
      "And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.\n",
      "As the nations which the LORD destroys before your face, so shall you perish; because you would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God.\n",
      "Hear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,\n",
      "A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!\n",
      "Understand therefore this day, that the LORD your God is he which goes over before you; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said to you.\n",
      "Speak not you in your heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.\n",
      "Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n",
      "Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff necked people.\n",
      "Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.\n",
      "Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.\n",
      "When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.\n",
      "Furthermore the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:\n",
      "Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.\n",
      "So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.\n",
      "And I looked, and, behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.\n",
      "And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.\n",
      "And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me at that time also.\n",
      "And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.\n",
      "And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.\n",
      "And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.\n",
      "Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and you believed him not, nor listened to his voice.\n",
      "You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.\n",
      "Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.\n",
      "I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.\n",
      "Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:\n",
      "Lest the land from where you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.\n",
      "Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.\n",
      "At that time the LORD said to me, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first, and come up to me into the mount, and make you an ark of wood.\n",
      "And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.\n",
      "And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like to the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.\n",
      "And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.\n",
      "And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.\n",
      "And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.\n",
      "From there they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.\n",
      "At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.\n",
      "Why Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.\n",
      "And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.\n",
      "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,\n",
      "To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?\n",
      "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's your God, the earth also, with all that therein is.\n",
      "Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.\n",
      "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.\n",
      "For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:\n",
      "He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.\n",
      "Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.\n",
      "He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.\n",
      "Your fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.\n",
      "Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.\n",
      "And know you this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,\n",
      "And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;\n",
      "And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day;\n",
      "And what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came into this place;\n",
      "And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:\n",
      "But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.\n",
      "Therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go to possess it;\n",
      "And that you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk and honey.\n",
      "For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:\n",
      "But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:\n",
      "A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,\n",
      "That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.\n",
      "And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.\n",
      "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;\n",
      "And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.\n",
      "Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.\n",
      "And you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.\n",
      "And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:\n",
      "That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven on the earth.\n",
      "For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to join to him;\n",
      "Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.\n",
      "Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.\n",
      "There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has said to you.\n",
      "Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;\n",
      "A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:\n",
      "And a curse, if you will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when the LORD your God has brought you in to the land where you go to possess it, that you shall put the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the curse on mount Ebal.\n",
      "Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?\n",
      "For you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.\n",
      "And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.\n",
      "These are the statutes and judgments, which you shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of your fathers gives you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.\n",
      "You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:\n",
      "And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\n",
      "You shall not do so to the LORD your God.\n",
      "But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:\n",
      "And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:\n",
      "And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.\n",
      "You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.\n",
      "For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.\n",
      "But when you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;\n",
      "Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:\n",
      "And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.\n",
      "Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:\n",
      "But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.\n",
      "Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.\n",
      "Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth as water.\n",
      "You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:\n",
      "But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.\n",
      "Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the Levite as long as you live on the earth.\n",
      "When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, whatever your soul lusts after.\n",
      "If the place which the LORD your God has chosen to put his name there be too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat in your gates whatever your soul lusts after.\n",
      "Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.\n",
      "Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh.\n",
      "You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth as water.\n",
      "You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:\n",
      "And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God: and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh.\n",
      "Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.\n",
      "When the LORD your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you succeed them, and dwell in their land;\n",
      "Take heed to yourself that you be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before you; and that you inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.\n",
      "You shall not do so to the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.\n",
      "What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.\n",
      "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,\n",
      "And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;\n",
      "You shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proves you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\n",
      "You shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and join to him.\n",
      "And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he has spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put the evil away from the middle of you.\n",
      "If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;\n",
      "Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;\n",
      "You shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:\n",
      "But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.\n",
      "And you shall stone him with stones, that he die; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n",
      "And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.\n",
      "If you shall hear say in one of your cities, which the LORD your God has given you to dwell there, saying,\n",
      "Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;\n",
      "Then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is worked among you;\n",
      "You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the middle of the street thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD your God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.\n",
      "And there shall stick nothing of the cursed thing to your hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers;\n",
      "When you shall listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD your God.\n",
      "You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.\n",
      "For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.\n",
      "You shall not eat any abominable thing.\n",
      "These are the beasts which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,\n",
      "The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.\n",
      "And every beast that parts the hoof, and separates the cleft into two claws, and chews the cud among the beasts, that you shall eat.\n",
      "Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean to you.\n",
      "And the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is unclean to you: you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.\n",
      "These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall you eat:\n",
      "And whatever has not fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean to you.\n",
      "Of all clean birds you shall eat.\n",
      "But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,\n",
      "And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,\n",
      "And every raven after his kind,\n",
      "And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,\n",
      "The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,\n",
      "And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,\n",
      "And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n",
      "And every creeping thing that flies is unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.\n",
      "But of all clean fowls you may eat.\n",
      "You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God.  You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\n",
      "You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.\n",
      "And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.\n",
      "And if the way be too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from you, which the LORD your God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD your God has blessed you:\n",
      "Then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which the LORD your God shall choose:\n",
      "And you shall bestow that money for whatever your soul lusts after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul desires: and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you, and your household,\n",
      "And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you.\n",
      "At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:\n",
      "And the Levite, (because he has no part nor inheritance with you,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.\n",
      "At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.\n",
      "And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.\n",
      "Of a foreigner you may exact it again: but that which is your with your brother your hand shall release;\n",
      "Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it:\n",
      "Only if you carefully listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command you this day.\n",
      "For the LORD your God blesses you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.\n",
      "If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:\n",
      "But you shall open your hand wide to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wants.\n",
      "Beware that there be not a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to the LORD against you, and it be sin to you.\n",
      "You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him: because that for this thing the LORD your God shall bless you in all your works, and in all that you put your hand to.\n",
      "For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land.\n",
      "And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.\n",
      "And when you send him out free from you, you shall not let him go away empty:\n",
      "You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your floor, and out of your wine press: of that with which the LORD your God has blessed you you shall give to him.\n",
      "And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing to day.\n",
      "And it shall be, if he say to you, I will not go away from you; because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;\n",
      "Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.\n",
      "It shall not seem hard to you, when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant to you, in serving you six years: and the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do.\n",
      "All the firstling males that come of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to the LORD your God: you shall do no work with the firstling of your bullock, nor shear the firstling of your sheep.\n",
      "You shall eat it before the LORD your God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, you and your household.\n",
      "And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.\n",
      "You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.\n",
      "Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it on the ground as water.\n",
      "Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD your God: for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.\n",
      "You shall therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.\n",
      "You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.\n",
      "And there shall be no leavened bread seen with you in all your coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which you sacrificed the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.\n",
      "You may not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which the LORD your God gives you:\n",
      "But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.\n",
      "And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the LORD your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents.\n",
      "Six days you shall eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God: you shall do no work therein.\n",
      "Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.\n",
      "And you shall keep the feast of weeks to the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give to the LORD your God, according as the LORD your God has blessed you:\n",
      "And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.\n",
      "And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.\n",
      "You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:\n",
      "And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.\n",
      "Seven days shall you keep a solemn feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in all the works of your hands, therefore you shall surely rejoice.\n",

      "If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has worked wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,\n",
      "And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;\n",
      "And it be told you, and you have heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is worked in Israel:\n",
      "Then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, to your gates, even that man or that woman, and shall stone them with stones, till they die.\n",
      "At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.\n",
      "The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall put the evil away from among you.\n",
      "If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;\n",
      "And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:\n",
      "And you shall do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show you; and you shall observe to do according to all that they inform you:\n",
      "According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do: you shall not decline from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.\n",

      "But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.\n",
      "Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.\n",

      "Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\n",
      "For all that do these things are an abomination to the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you.\n",
      "You shall be perfect with the LORD your God.\n",
      "For these nations, which you shall possess, listened to observers of times, and to diviners: but as for you, the LORD your God has not suffered you so to do.\n",

      "According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.\n",
      "And the LORD said to me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.\n",
      "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\n",
      "But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\n",
      "And if you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?\n",
      "When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.\n",
      "When the LORD your God has cut off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;\n",
      "You shall separate three cities for you in the middle of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.\n",
      "You shall prepare you a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.\n",
      "And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;\n",
      "As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lights on his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee to one of those cities, and live:\n",
      "Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.\n",
      "Why I command you, saying, You shall separate three cities for you.\n",
      "And if the LORD your God enlarge your coast, as he has sworn to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;\n",
      "If you shall keep all these commandments to do them, which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you, beside these three:\n",
      "That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be on you.\n",
      "But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and flees into one of these cities:\n",
      "Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.\n",
      "Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.\n",

      "One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.\n",
      "If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;\n",
      "Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;\n",
      "And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;\n",
      "Then shall you do to him, as he had thought to have done to his brother: so shall you put the evil away from among you.\n",
      "And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall from now on commit no more any such evil among you.\n",

      "And it shall be, when you are come near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,\n",
      "And shall say to them, Hear, O Israel, you approach this day to battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be you terrified because of them;\n",
      "For the LORD your God is he that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.\n",
      "And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.\n",
      "And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.\n",
      "And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.\n",
      "And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.\n",
      "And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.\n",
      "When you come near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.\n",
      "And it shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries to you, and they shall serve you.\n",
      "And if it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:\n",
      "And when the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:\n",
      "But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shall you take to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.\n",
      "Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.\n",
      "But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God does give you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes:\n",
      "But you shall utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you:\n",
      "That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so should you sin against the LORD your God.\n",
      "When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:\n",
      "Only the trees which you know that they be not trees for meat, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it be subdued.\n",
      "If one be found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who has slain him:\n",
      "Then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are round about him that is slain:\n",
      "And it shall be, that the city which is next to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which has not been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke;\n",
      "And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:\n",
      "And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:\n",
      "And all the elders of that city, that are next to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:\n",
      "And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.\n",
      "Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to your people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.\n",
      "So shall you put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,\n",
      "And see among the captives a beautiful woman, and have a desire to her, that you would have her to your wife;\n",
      "Then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;\n",
      "And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month: and after that you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.\n",
      "And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not make merchandise of her, because you have humbled her.\n",
      "If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:\n",
      "Then it shall be, when he makes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:\n",
      "But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.\n",
      "If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:\n",
      "Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;\n",
      "And they shall say to the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.\n",
      "And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shall you put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.\n",
      "And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:\n",
      "His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.\n",
      "You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall in any case bring them again to your brother.\n",
      "And if your brother be not near to you, or if you know him not, then you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him again.\n",
      "In like manner shall you do with his ass; and so shall you do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found, shall you do likewise: you may not hide yourself.\n",
      "You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.\n",
      "The woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination to the LORD your God.\n",
      "If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the dam with the young:\n",
      "But you shall in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to you; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.\n",
      "When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.\n",
      "You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.\n",
      "You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.\n",
      "You shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.\n",
      "You shall make you fringes on the four quarters of your clothing, with which you cover yourself.\n",
      "If any man take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,\n",
      "And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name on her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:\n",
      "Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate:\n",
      "And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;\n",
      "And, see, he has given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not your daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.\n",
      "And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;\n",
      "And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.\n",
      "But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:\n",
      "Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.\n",
      "If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.\n",
      "If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;\n",
      "Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away evil from among you.\n",
      "But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.\n",
      "But to the damsel you shall do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, even so is this matter:\n",
      "For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.\n",
      "If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;\n",

      "And the LORD your God will make you plenteous in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers:\n",
      "If you shall listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.\n",
      "For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.\n",
      "It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?\n",
      "Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?\n",
      "But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.\n",
      "See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;\n",
      "In that I command you this day to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that you may live and multiply: and the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.\n",
      "But if your heart turn away, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;\n",
      "I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish, and that you shall not prolong your days on the land, where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:\n",
      "That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\n",
      "And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.\n",
      "And he said to them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.\n",
      "The LORD your God, he will go over before you, and he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before you, as the LORD has said.\n",
      "And the LORD shall do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to the land of them, whom he destroyed.\n",
      "And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that you may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.\n",
      "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.\n",
      "And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.\n",
      "And the LORD, he it is that does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: fear not, neither be dismayed.\n",
      "And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.\n",
      "And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,\n",
      "When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.\n",
      "Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:\n",
      "And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over Jordan to possess it.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.\n",
      "Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come on us, because our God is not among us?\n",
      "And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.\n",
      "Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.\n",
      "For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.\n",
      "Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.\n",
      "And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,\n",
      "That Moses commanded the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,\n",
      "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.\n",
      "For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?\n",
      "Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.\n",
      "For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.\n",
      "And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.\n",
      "Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.\n",
      "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:\n",
      "Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe you greatness to our God.\n",
      "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.\n",
      "They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.\n",
      "Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?\n",
      "Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.\n",
      "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.\n",
      "For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\n",
      "He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.\n",
      "As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:\n",
      "So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.\n",
      "He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;\n",
      "Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.\n",
      "But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.\n",
      "They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.\n",
      "They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.\n",
      "Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.\n",
      "And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.\n",
      "And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very fraudulent generation, children in whom is no faith.\n",
      "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\n",
      "For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.\n",
      "I will heap mischiefs on them; I will spend my arrows on them.\n",
      "They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts on them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n",
      "The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.\n",
      "I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:\n",
      "Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.\n",
      "For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.\n",
      "O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\n",
      "How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?\n",
      "For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.\n",
      "For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:\n",
      "Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\n",
      "Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?\n",
      "To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.\n",
      "For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.\n",
      "And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,\n",
      "Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.\n",
      "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.\n",
      "For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.\n",
      "If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.\n",
      "I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.\n",
      "Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.\n",
      "And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.\n",
      "And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:\n",
      "And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.\n",
      "For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over Jordan to possess it.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,\n",
      "Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:\n",
      "And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:\n",
      "Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Yet you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.\n",
      "And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.\n",
      "And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.\n",
      "Yes, he loved the people; all his saints are in your hand: and they sat down at your feet; every one shall receive of your words.\n",
      "Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\n",
      "And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.\n",
      "Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.\n",
      "And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be you an help to him from his enemies.\n",
      "And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;\n",
      "Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor knew his own children: for they have observed your word, and kept your covenant.\n",
      "They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice on your altar.\n",
      "Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.\n",
      "And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.\n",
      "And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,\n",
      "And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,\n",
      "And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,\n",
      "And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelled in the bush: let the blessing come on the head of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.\n",
      "His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.\n",
      "And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.\n",
      "They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.\n",
      "And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm with the crown of the head.\n",
      "And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.\n",
      "And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.\n",
      "And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south.\n",
      "And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.\n",
      "Your shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be.\n",
      "There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.\n",
      "The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.\n",
      "Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be on a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.\n",
      "Happy are you, O Israel: who is like to you, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency! and your enemies shall be found liars to you; and you shall tread on their high places.\n",
      "And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,\n",
      "And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea,\n",
      "And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, to Zoar.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over thither.\n",
      "So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.\n",
      "And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.\n",
      "And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.\n",
      "And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,\n",
      "In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,\n",
      "And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.\n",
      "Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,\n",
      "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.\n",
      "Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread on, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.\n",
      "From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.\n",
      "There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.\n",
      "Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.\n",
      "Only be you strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.\n",
      "This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.\n",
      "Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.\n",
      "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,\n",
      "Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.\n",
      "And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.\n",
      "Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;\n",
      "Until the LORD have given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them: then you shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sun rise.\n",
      "And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us, we will go.\n",
      "According as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you: only the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses.\n",
      "Whoever he be that does rebel against your commandment, and will not listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\n",
      "And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.\n",
      "And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you, which are entered into your house: for they be come to search out all the country.\n",
      "And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not from where they were:\n",
      "And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you shall overtake them.\n",
      "But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.\n",
      "And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.\n",
      "And before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof;\n",
      "And she said to the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.\n",
      "For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.\n",
      "And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:\n",
      "And that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\n",
      "And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.\n",
      "Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.\n",
      "And she said to them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way.\n",
      "And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this your oath which you have made us swear.\n",
      "Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household, home to you.\n",
      "And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be on him.\n",
      "And if you utter this our business, then we will be quit of your oath which you have made us to swear.\n",
      "And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.\n",
      "And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.\n",
      "So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:\n",
      "And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.\n",
      "And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.\n",
      "And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;\n",
      "And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.\n",
      "Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way heretofore.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.\n",
      "And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.\n",
      "And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in Jordan.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan.\n",
      "Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand on an heap.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;\n",
      "And as they that bore the ark were come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overflows all his banks all the time of harvest,)\n",
      "That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up on an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.\n",
      "And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,\n",
      "And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the middle of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night.\n",
      "Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:\n",
      "And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:\n",
      "That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?\n",
      "Then you shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of Jordan, as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.\n",
      "And Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.\n",
      "For the priests which bore the ark stood in the middle of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hurried and passed over.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them:\n",
      "About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.\n",
      "Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you up out of Jordan.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the middle of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.\n",
      "And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.\n",
      "And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.\n",
      "And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?\n",
      "Then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.\n",
      "For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:\n",
      "That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you might fear the LORD your God for ever.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.\n",
      "And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.\n",
      "And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.\n",
      "Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.\n",
      "For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.\n",
      "And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp, till they were whole.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.\n",
      "And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.\n",
      "And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?\n",
      "And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What said my Lord to his servant?\n",
      "And the captain of the LORD's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your foot; for the place where on you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.\n",
      "Now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "And you shall compass the city, all you men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.\n",
      "And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.\n",
      "And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\n",
      "And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout.\n",
      "So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.\n",
      "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\n",
      "And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city.\n",
      "And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.\n",
      "And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\n",
      "But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.\n",
      "So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.\n",
      "And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "But Joshua had said to the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore to her.\n",
      "And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.\n",
      "And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\n",
      "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\n",
      "So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.\n",
      "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country.  And the men went up and viewed Ai.\n",
      "And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.\n",
      "So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.\n",
      "And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: why the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.\n",
      "And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side Jordan!\n",
      "O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!\n",
      "For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do to your great name?\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Get you up; why lie you thus on your face?\n",
      "Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except you destroy the accursed from among you.\n",
      "Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus said the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the middle of you, O Israel: you can not stand before your enemies, until you take away the accursed thing from among you.\n",
      "In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.\n",
      "And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has worked folly in Israel.\n",
      "So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:\n",
      "And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:\n",
      "And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.\n",
      "And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.\n",
      "And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:\n",
      "When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.\n",
      "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.\n",
      "And they took them out of the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.\n",
      "And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Why the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:\n",
      "And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall you take for a prey to yourselves: lay you an ambush for the city behind it.\n",
      "So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be you all ready:\n",
      "And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,\n",
      "(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.\n",
      "Then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize on the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.\n",
      "And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall you do. See, I have commanded you.\n",
      "Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.\n",
      "And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.\n",
      "And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.\n",
      "And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.\n",
      "And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.\n",
      "And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.\n",
      "And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.\n",
      "And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.\n",
      "And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hurried and set the city on fire.\n",
      "And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.\n",
      "And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.\n",
      "And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.\n",
      "And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.\n",
      "For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\n",
      "Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.\n",
      "And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.\n",
      "And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remains to this day.\n",
      "Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,\n",
      "As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.\n",
      "And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.\n",
      "And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.\n",
      "There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;\n",
      "That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.\n",
      "And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,\n",
      "They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;\n",
      "And old shoes and clouted on their feet, and old garments on them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.\n",
      "And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make you a league with us.\n",
      "And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?\n",
      "And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you? and from from where come you?\n",
      "And they said to him, From a very far country your servants are come because of the name of the LORD your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,\n",
      "And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.\n",
      "Why our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: therefore now make you a league with us.\n",
      "This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:\n",
      "And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.\n",
      "And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelled among them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.\n",
      "And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.\n",
      "But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.\n",
      "This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.\n",
      "And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.\n",
      "And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when you dwell among us?\n",
      "Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.\n",
      "And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your servants, how that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.\n",
      "And now, behold, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do.\n",
      "And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.\n",
      "And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.\n",
      "Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;\n",
      "That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.\n",
      "Why Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,\n",
      "Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.\n",
      "Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.\n",
      "And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.\n",
      "So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into your hand; there shall not a man of them stand before you.\n",
      "Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.\n",
      "And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\n",
      "Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still on Gibeon; and you, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\n",
      "And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the middle of heaven, and hurried not to go down about a whole day.\n",
      "And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD listened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.\n",
      "But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.\n",
      "And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.\n",
      "And Joshua said, Roll great stones on the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:\n",
      "And stay you not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.\n",
      "And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me out of the cave.\n",
      "And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.\n",
      "And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom you fight.\n",
      "And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.\n",
      "And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did to the king thereof as he did to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:\n",
      "And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.\n",
      "Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.\n",
      "And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:\n",
      "And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.\n",
      "And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:\n",
      "And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:\n",
      "And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.\n",
      "So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.\n",
      "And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.\n",
      "And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,\n",
      "And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,\n",
      "And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.\n",
      "And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.\n",
      "And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.\n",
      "So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell on them.\n",
      "And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.\n",
      "And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.\n",
      "And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.\n",
      "And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.\n",
      "And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.\n",
      "But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.\n",
      "And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;\n",
      "Even from the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.\n",
      "Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.\n",
      "There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.\n",
      "For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.\n",
      "There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.\n",
      "So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.\n",
      "Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:\n",
      "Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:\n",
      "And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelled at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,\n",
      "And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.\n",
      "Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.\n",
      "And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even to the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;\n",
      "In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:\n",
      "The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;\n",
      "The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;\n",
      "The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;\n",
      "The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;\n",
      "The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;\n",
      "The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;\n",
      "The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;\n",
      "The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;\n",
      "The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;\n",
      "The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;\n",
      "The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;\n",
      "The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;\n",
      "The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;\n",
      "The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;\n",
      "The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;\n",
      "The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.\n",
      "Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.\n",
      "This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,\n",
      "From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:\n",
      "From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:\n",
      "And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.\n",
      "All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.\n",
      "Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,\n",
      "With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;\n",
      "From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;\n",
      "And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;\n",
      "All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.\n",
      "Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.\n",
      "Only to the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said to them.\n",
      "And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.\n",
      "And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;\n",
      "Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,\n",
      "And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,\n",
      "And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,\n",
      "And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,\n",
      "And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.\n",
      "Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.\n",
      "And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.\n",
      "And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families.\n",
      "And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;\n",
      "And from Heshbon to Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;\n",
      "And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.\n",
      "This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.\n",
      "And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.\n",
      "And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, three score cities:\n",
      "And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.\n",
      "These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.\n",
      "But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said to them.\n",
      "And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.\n",
      "By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.\n",
      "For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but to the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.\n",
      "For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.\n",
      "As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.\n",
      "Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.\n",
      "Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.\n",
      "Nevertheless my brothers that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.\n",
      "And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where on your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your children's for ever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.\n",
      "And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, see, I am this day fourscore and five years old.\n",
      "As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.\n",
      "Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.\n",
      "And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.\n",
      "Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.\n",
      "This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.\n",
      "And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looks southward:\n",
      "And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side to Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:\n",
      "From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.\n",
      "And the east border was the salt sea, even to the end of Jordan.  And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:\n",
      "And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:\n",
      "And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:\n",
      "And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:\n",
      "And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:\n",
      "And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:\n",
      "And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.\n",
      "And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.  This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.\n",
      "And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.\n",
      "And Caleb drove there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.\n",
      "And he went up there to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.\n",
      "And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\n",
      "And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What would you?\n",
      "Who answered, Give me a blessing; for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\n",
      "This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.\n",
      "And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,\n",
      "And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,\n",

      "And goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.\n",
      "So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.\n",
      "And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, to Bethhoron the upper;\n",
      "And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;\n",
      "And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.\n",
      "The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.\n",
      "And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.\n",
      "And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.\n",
      "There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.\n",
      "There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.\n",
      "But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.\n",
      "And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.\n",
      "And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;\n",
      "Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of Entappuah.\n",
      "Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;\n",
      "And the coast descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:\n",
      "Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.\n",
      "And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.\n",
      "Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.\n",
      "And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, for as much as the LORD has blessed me till now?\n",
      "And Joshua answered them, If you be a great people, then get you up to the wood country, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for you.\n",
      "And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power: you shall not have one lot only:\n",
      "But the mountain shall be yours; for it is a wood, and you shall cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.\n",
      "And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.\n",
      "And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?\n",
      "Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.\n",
      "And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.\n",
      "You shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.\n",
      "But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.\n",
      "And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.\n",
      "And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.\n",
      "And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.\n",
      "And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.\n",
      "And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.\n",
      "And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.\n",
      "And the border was drawn there, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lies before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.\n",
      "And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:\n",
      "And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,\n",
      "And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,\n",
      "And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:\n",
      "And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.\n",
      "And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.\n",
      "Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,\n",

      "Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.\n",
      "And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid:\n",
      "And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;\n",

      "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:\n",
      "That the slayer that kills any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.\n",
      "And when he that does flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.\n",
      "And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.\n",
      "And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from from where he fled.\n",
      "And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.\n",
      "And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.\n",
      "These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them, that whoever kills any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.\n",
      "Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;\n",
      "And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.\n",
      "And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.\n",
      "And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.\n",
      "And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.\n",

      "All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.\n",

      "All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.\n",
      "And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,\n",

      "All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,\n",
      "Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,\n",
      "Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.\n",
      "And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,\n",
      "Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.\n",
      "So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.\n",
      "All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.\n",
      "These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.\n",
      "And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelled therein.\n",
      "And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.\n",
      "There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.\n",
      "Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,\n",
      "And said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:\n",
      "You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.\n",
      "And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them: therefore now return you, and get you to your tents, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.\n",
      "But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to hold to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.\n",
      "So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went to their tents.\n",
      "Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but to the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brothers on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,\n",
      "And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.\n",
      "And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,\n",
      "And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.\n",
      "And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,\n",
      "Thus said the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that you have built you an altar, that you might rebel this day against the LORD?\n",
      "Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,\n",
      "But that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing you rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.\n",
      "Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.\n",
      "Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,\n",
      "The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knows, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)\n",
      "That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;\n",
      "And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?\n",
      "For the LORD has made Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.\n",
      "Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:\n",
      "But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, You have no part in the LORD.\n",
      "Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.\n",
      "God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.\n",
      "And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.\n",
      "And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.\n",
      "And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.\n",
      "And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelled.\n",
      "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.\n",
      "And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.\n",
      "And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and stricken in age:\n",
      "And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that has fought for you.\n",
      "Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.\n",
      "And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised to you.\n",
      "Be you therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;\n",
      "That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:\n",
      "But hold to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.\n",
      "For the LORD has driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day.\n",
      "One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you.\n",
      "Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God.\n",
      "Else if you do in any wise go back, and join to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you:\n",
      "Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.\n",
      "And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass to you, and not one thing has failed thereof.\n",
      "Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come on you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring on you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.\n",
      "When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you.\n",
      "And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.\n",
      "And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.\n",
      "And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.\n",
      "And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\n",
      "I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.\n",
      "And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.\n",
      "And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and you dwelled in the wilderness a long season.\n",
      "And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelled on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.\n",
      "Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:\n",
      "But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.\n",
      "And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with your sword, nor with your bow.\n",
      "And I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you built not, and you dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive groves which you planted not do you eat.\n",
      "Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.\n",
      "And if it seem evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.\n",
      "And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;\n",
      "For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:\n",
      "And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelled in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.\n",
      "If you forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he has done you good.\n",
      "And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.\n",
      "Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.\n",
      "So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.\n",
      "And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest you deny your God.\n",
      "So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\n",
      "And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.\n",
      "And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.\n",
      "And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.\n",
      "And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.\n",
      "Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?\n",
      "And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.\n",
      "And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.\n",
      "And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.\n",
      "And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\n",
      "But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\n",
      "And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.\n",
      "Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.\n",
      "And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.\n",
      "And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.\n",
      "And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:\n",
      "And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\n",
      "And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What will you?\n",
      "And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.\n",
      "And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.\n",
      "And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.\n",
      "Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.\n",
      "And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\n",
      "And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.\n",
      "And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)\n",
      "And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.\n",
      "And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.\n",
      "And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof to this day.\n",
      "Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.\n",
      "Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelled in Gezer among them.\n",
      "Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.\n",
      "Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:\n",
      "But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.\n",
      "Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.\n",
      "And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:\n",
      "But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.\n",
      "And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\n",
      "And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.\n",
      "And you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; you shall throw down their altars: but you have not obeyed my voice: why have you done this?\n",
      "Why I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.\n",
      "And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.\n",
      "And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.\n",
      "And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\n",
      "And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.\n",
      "And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.\n",
      "And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.\n",
      "Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.\n",
      "Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.\n",
      "And yet they would not listen to their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.\n",
      "And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;\n",
      "I also will not from now on drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:\n",
      "That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.\n",
      "Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.\n",
      "Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\n",
      "Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;\n",
      "Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.\n",
      "And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.\n",
      "And the children of Israel dwelled among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:\n",
      "And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.\n",
      "Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.\n",
      "And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.\n",
      "And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.\n",
      "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.\n",
      "But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.\n",
      "But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment on his right thigh.\n",
      "And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.\n",
      "And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.\n",
      "But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\n",
      "And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.  And he arose out of his seat.\n",
      "And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:\n",
      "And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.\n",
      "Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor on him, and locked them.\n",
      "When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.\n",
      "And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.\n",
      "And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.\n",
      "And he said to them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.\n",
      "And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.\n",
      "So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.\n",
      "And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.\n",
      "And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.\n",
      "And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.\n",
      "And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?\n",
      "And I will draw to you to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.\n",
      "And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go.\n",
      "And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\n",
      "And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.\n",
      "Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.\n",
      "And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.\n",
      "And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.\n",
      "And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.\n",
      "And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\n",
      "But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.\n",
      "However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n",
      "And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.\n",
      "And he said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.\n",
      "Again he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.\n",
      "Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.\n",
      "And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.\n",
      "So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n",
      "Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\n",
      "Praise you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.\n",
      "Hear, O you kings; give ear, O you princes; I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.\n",
      "The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.\n",
      "The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\n",
      "They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\n",
      "My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless you the LORD.\n",
      "Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.\n",
      "They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.\n",
      "Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.\n",
      "Then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\n",
      "Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.\n",
      "And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.\n",
      "Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.\n",
      "Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.\n",
      "Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.\n",
      "The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\n",
      "They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.\n",
      "The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, you have trodden down strength.\n",
      "Then were the horse hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.\n",
      "Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.\n",
      "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n",
      "He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\n",
      "She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.\n",
      "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\n",
      "The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?\n",
      "Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself,\n",
      "Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needlework, of divers colors of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?\n",
      "So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\n",
      "And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.\n",
      "And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;\n",
      "And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\n",
      "For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.\n",
      "And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,\n",
      "That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, which said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;\n",
      "And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;\n",
      "And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but you have not obeyed my voice.\n",
      "And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor.\n",
      "And Gideon said to him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD has forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.\n",
      "And the LORD looked on him, and said, Go in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent you?\n",
      "And he said to him, Oh my Lord, with which shall I save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midianites as one man.\n",
      "And he said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, then show me a sign that you talk with me.\n",
      "Depart not hence, I pray you, until I come to you, and bring forth my present, and set it before you. And he said, I will tarry until you come again.\n",
      "And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\n",
      "And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.\n",
      "Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.\n",
      "And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die.\n",
      "Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:\n",
      "And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.\n",
      "Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.\n",
      "And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.\n",
      "And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.\n",
      "Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the grove that was by it.\n",
      "And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.\n",
      "Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.\n",
      "Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.\n",
      "And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,\n",
      "Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.\n",
      "And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.\n",
      "And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.\n",
      "And God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\n",
      "Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.\n",
      "Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.\n",
      "So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down on his knees to drink.\n",
      "And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.\n",
      "So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.\n",
      "And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.\n",
      "But if you fear to go down, go you with Phurah your servant down to the host:\n",
      "And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.\n",
      "And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.\n",
      "And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.\n",
      "And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.\n",
      "And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.\n",
      "And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.\n",
      "And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.\n",
      "When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.\n",
      "And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.\n",
      "And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.\n",
      "And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.\n",
      "And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.\n",
      "And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.\n",
      "And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb on the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.\n",
      "And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?\n",
      "God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.\n",
      "And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.\n",
      "And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\n",
      "And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?\n",
      "And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.\n",
      "And he went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.\n",
      "And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.\n",
      "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.\n",
      "And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelled in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.\n",
      "And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,\n",
      "And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even three score and seventeen men.\n",
      "And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom you did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men that are weary?\n",
      "And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.\n",
      "And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.\n",
      "Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.\n",
      "And he said, They were my brothers, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.\n",
      "And he said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\n",
      "Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.\n",
      "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also: for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.\n",
      "And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\n",
      "And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.\n",
      "And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.\n",
      "And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.\n",
      "Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.\n",
      "And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelled in his own house.\n",
      "And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.\n",
      "And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.\n",
      "And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:\n",
      "Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed to Israel.\n",
      "And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,\n",
      "Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are three score and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "And his mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\n",
      "And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.\n",
      "And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being three score and ten persons, on one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.\n",
      "And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.\n",
      "And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.\n",
      "The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.\n",
      "But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.\n",
      "But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said the trees to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?\n",
      "Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.\n",
      "And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\n",
      "Now therefore, if you have done truly and sincerely, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;\n",
      "(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:\n",
      "And you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, three score and ten persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)\n",
      "If you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:\n",
      "But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.\n",
      "And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelled there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\n",
      "When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,\n",
      "Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:\n",
      "That the cruelty done to the three score and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and on the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brothers.\n",
      "And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.\n",
      "And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?\n",
      "And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out.\n",
      "And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\n",
      "And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.\n",
      "Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:\n",
      "And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set on the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.\n",
      "And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\n",
      "And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.\n",
      "And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\n",
      "And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.\n",
      "Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.\n",
      "And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.\n",
      "And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entering of the gate.\n",
      "And Abimelech dwelled at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.\n",
      "And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.\n",
      "And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran on all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.\n",
      "And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.\n",
      "And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.\n",
      "And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.\n",
      "And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.\n",
      "And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\n",
      "Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.\n",
      "But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.\n",
      "And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and went hard to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\n",
      "And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone on Abimelech's head, and all to broke his skull.\n",
      "Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.\n",
      "Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers:\n",
      "And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\n",
      "And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelled in Shamir in mount Ephraim.\n",
      "And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\n",
      "And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\n",
      "Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.\n",
      "And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.\n",
      "And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\n",
      "The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.\n",
      "Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods: why I will deliver you no more.\n",
      "Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day.\n",
      "And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n",
      "Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.\n",
      "And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.\n",
      "Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelled in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:\n",
      "And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did not you hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are you come to me now when you are in distress?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?\n",
      "And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to your words.\n",
      "Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?\n",
      "And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.\n",
      "And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "And said to him, Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:\n",
      "But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;\n",
      "Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.\n",
      "Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.\n",
      "And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place.\n",
      "But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\n",
      "And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.\n",
      "So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?\n",
      "Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.\n",
      "And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,\n",
      "While Israel dwelled in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did you not recover them within that time?\n",
      "Why I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.\n",
      "However, the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.\n",
      "Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,\n",
      "Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.\n",
      "So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\n",
      "And he smote them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.\n",
      "And she said to him, My father, if you have opened your mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; for as much as the LORD has taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains, and mourn my virginity, I and my fellows.\n",
      "And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,\n",
      "That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\n",
      "And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.\n",
      "And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you delivered me not out of their hands.\n",
      "And when I saw that you delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up to me this day, to fight against me?\n",
      "Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.\n",
      "And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;\n",
      "Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.\n",
      "And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\n",
      "And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.\n",
      "Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.\n",
      "And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.\n",
      "And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.\n",
      "And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.\n",
      "And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\n",
      "And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.\n",
      "And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.\n",
      "Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:\n",
      "For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:\n",
      "But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.\n",
      "Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.\n",
      "And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.\n",
      "And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, that came to me the other day.\n",
      "And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.\n",
      "And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.\n",
      "She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honor?\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?\n",
      "So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.\n",
      "For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.\n",
      "And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.\n",
      "But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.\n",
      "And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n",
      "And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.\n",
      "And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.\n",
      "Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.\n",
      "But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.\n",
      "Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.\n",
      "And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.\n",
      "And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.\n",
      "So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:\n",
      "But if you cannot declare it me, then shall you give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.\n",
      "And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?\n",
      "And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it you?\n",
      "And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore on him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\n",
      "And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?  and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.\n",
      "But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.\n",
      "But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.\n",
      "And her father said, I truly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray you, instead of her.\n",
      "And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\n",
      "And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the middle between two tails.\n",
      "And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.\n",
      "Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\n",
      "And Samson said to them, Though you have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\n",
      "And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelled in the top of the rock Etam.\n",
      "Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\n",
      "And the men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us.\n",
      "Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.\n",
      "And they said to him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that you will not fall on me yourselves.\n",
      "And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.\n",
      "And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and the cords that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.\n",
      "And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.\n",
      "And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.\n",
      "And he was sore thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, You have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?\n",
      "But God split an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of there; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: why he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.\n",
      "And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.\n",
      "Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in to her.\n",
      "And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.\n",
      "And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.\n",
      "And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\n",
      "And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray you, wherein your great strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.\n",
      "And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green thongs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green thongs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\n",
      "Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.  And she said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he broke the thongs, as a thread of wick is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray you, with which you might be bound.\n",
      "And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\n",
      "Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.\n",
      "And Delilah said to Samson, Till now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with which you might be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.\n",
      "And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.\n",
      "And she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me wherein your great strength lies.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death;\n",
      "That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor on my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.\n",
      "And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought money in their hand.\n",
      "And she made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\n",
      "And she said, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD was departed from him.\n",
      "But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.\n",
      "However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\n",
      "And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.\n",
      "And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house stands, that I may lean on them.\n",
      "Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.\n",
      "And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray you, and strengthen me, I pray you, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\n",
      "And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.\n",
      "And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.\n",
      "Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial plot of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.\n",
      "And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n",
      "And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son.\n",
      "And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.\n",
      "Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.\n",
      "And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.\n",
      "And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.\n",
      "And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.\n",
      "And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\n",
      "And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.\n",
      "When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what make you in this place? and what have you here?\n",
      "And he said to them, Thus and thus deals Micah with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest.\n",
      "And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.\n",
      "And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein you go.\n",
      "Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.\n",
      "And they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What say you?\n",
      "And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are you still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.\n",
      "When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.\n",
      "And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: why they called that place Mahanehdan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.\n",
      "And they passed there to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.\n",
      "And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.\n",
      "And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.\n",
      "And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.\n",
      "And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do you?\n",
      "And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?\n",
      "And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.\n",
      "So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.\n",
      "And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.\n",
      "And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?\n",
      "And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that you say to me, What ails you?\n",
      "And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.\n",
      "And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.\n",
      "And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.\n",
      "And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.\n",
      "And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.\n",
      "And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.\n",
      "And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.\n",
      "And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.\n",
      "And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\n",
      "And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he stayed with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said to his son in law, Comfort your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.\n",
      "And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let your heart be merry.\n",
      "And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.\n",
      "And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort your heart, I pray you. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.\n",
      "And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.\n",
      "But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.\n",
      "And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\n",
      "And his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.\n",
      "And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\n",
      "And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them when they were by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.\n",
      "And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.\n",
      "And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.\n",
      "And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you? and from where come you?\n",
      "And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from there am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receives me to house.\n",
      "Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man which is with your servants: there is no want of any thing.\n",
      "And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only lodge not in the street.\n",
      "So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.\n",
      "Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.\n",
      "And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, no, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.\n",
      "Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.\n",
      "But the men would not listen to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.\n",
      "Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.\n",
      "And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.\n",
      "And he said to her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.  Then the man took her up on an ass, and the man rose up, and got him to his place.\n",
      "And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.\n",
      "And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\n",
      "(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?\n",
      "And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\n",
      "And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about on me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.\n",
      "And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.\n",
      "Behold, you are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.\n",
      "And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.\n",
      "But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;\n",
      "And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.\n",
      "So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\n",
      "And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?\n",
      "Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.\n",
      "But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\n",
      "Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left handed; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.\n",
      "And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\n",
      "And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.\n",
      "And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.\n",
      "And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.\n",
      "And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.\n",
      "(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)\n",
      "And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.\n",
      "And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.\n",
      "And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,\n",
      "And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.\n",
      "And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.\n",
      "And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.\n",
      "And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.\n",
      "And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.\n",
      "So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.\n",
      "And the liers in wait hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.\n",
      "But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come on them.\n",
      "Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the middle of them.\n",
      "Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and stepped them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sun rise.\n",
      "And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.\n",
      "So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and stayed in the rock Rimmon four months.\n",
      "And the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.\n",
      "Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin to wife.\n",
      "And the people came to the house of God, and stayed there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;\n",
      "And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\n",
      "How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?\n",
      "And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.\n",
      "For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.\n",
      "And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.\n",
      "And this is the thing that you shall do, You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain by man.\n",
      "And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.\n",
      "And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.\n",
      "And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?\n",
      "And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.\n",
      "However, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to Benjamin.\n",
      "Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.\n",
      "Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;\n",
      "And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\n",
      "And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for you did not give to them at this time, that you should be guilty.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelled in them.\n",
      "And the children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.\n",
      "And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.\n",
      "And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.\n",
      "And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.\n",
      "And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.\n",
      "Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\n",
      "Why she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.\n",
      "And Naomi said to her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.\n",
      "The LORD grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people.\n",
      "And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?\n",
      "Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;\n",
      "Would you tarry for them till they were grown? would you stay for them from having husbands? no, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.\n",
      "And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth joined to her.\n",
      "And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return you after your sister in law.\n",
      "And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:\n",
      "Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part you and me.\n",
      "When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking to her.\n",
      "So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?\n",
      "And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.\n",
      "I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?\n",
      "So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.\n",
      "And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.\n",
      "And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.  And she said to her, Go, my daughter.\n",
      "And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.\n",
      "And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you.\n",
      "Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?\n",
      "And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:\n",
      "And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.\n",
      "Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hear you not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:\n",
      "Let your eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go you after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.\n",
      "Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?\n",
      "And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done to your mother in law since the death of your husband: and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and are come to a people which you knew not heretofore.\n",
      "The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust.\n",
      "Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for that you have comforted me, and for that you have spoken friendly to your handmaid, though I be not like to one of your handmaidens.\n",
      "And Boaz said to her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.\n",
      "And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:\n",
      "And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.\n",
      "So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.\n",
      "And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.\n",
      "And her mother in law said to her, Where have you gleaned to day?  and where worked you? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked to day is Boaz.\n",
      "And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.\n",
      "And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.\n",
      "And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, that they meet you not in any other field.\n",
      "So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelled with her mother in law.\n",
      "Then Naomi her mother in law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?\n",
      "And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were?  Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.\n",
      "Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment on you, and get you down to the floor: but make not yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.\n",
      "And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.\n",
      "And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do.\n",
      "And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.\n",
      "And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.\n",
      "And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.\n",
      "And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followed not young men, whether poor or rich.\n",
      "And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.\n",
      "And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.\n",
      "Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.\n",
      "And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.\n",
      "Also he said, Bring the veil that you have on you, and hold it.  And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.\n",
      "And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.\n",
      "And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to your mother in law.\n",
      "Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.\n",
      "Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.\n",
      "And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down.\n",
      "And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:\n",
      "And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.\n",
      "Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.\n",
      "And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it.\n",
      "Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.\n",
      "Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe.\n",
      "And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.\n",
      "Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.\n",
      "And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:\n",
      "And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.\n",
      "So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.\n",
      "And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.\n",
      "And he shall be to you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of your old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.\n",
      "And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.\n",
      "And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.\n",
      "Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,\n",
      "And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,\n",
      "And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,\n",
      "And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,\n",
      "And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.\n",
      "Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:\n",
      "And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\n",
      "And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.\n",
      "And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:\n",
      "But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.\n",
      "And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.\n",
      "And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\n",
      "Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?\n",
      "So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat on a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.\n",
      "And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore.\n",
      "And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.\n",
      "Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.\n",
      "And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.\n",
      "And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.\n",
      "Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.\n",
      "Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.\n",
      "And she said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.\n",
      "And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.\n",
      "Why it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.\n",
      "And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\n",
      "But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.\n",
      "And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman stayed, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.\n",
      "And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.\n",
      "And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.\n",
      "And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to the LORD.\n",
      "For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:\n",
      "Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.\n",
      "And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation.\n",
      "There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.\n",
      "Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.\n",
      "The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.\n",
      "They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.\n",
      "The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.\n",
      "The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.\n",
      "He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world on them.\n",
      "He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.\n",
      "The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.\n",
      "And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister to the LORD before Eli the priest.\n",
      "Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.\n",
      "And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;\n",
      "And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.\n",
      "Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.\n",
      "And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, No; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.\n",
      "Why the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.\n",
      "But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.\n",
      "Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.\n",
      "And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.\n",
      "And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.\n",
      "Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n",
      "And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.\n",
      "No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to transgress.\n",
      "If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they listened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.\n",
      "And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.\n",
      "And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?\n",
      "And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer on my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?\n",
      "Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?\n",
      "Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.\n",
      "And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.\n",
      "And the man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart: and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.\n",
      "And this shall be a sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.\n",
      "And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in your house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.\n",
      "And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;\n",
      "And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;\n",
      "That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.\n",
      "And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.\n",
      "And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.\n",
      "Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.\n",
      "And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.\n",
      "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, LORD; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n",
      "And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for your servant hears.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.\n",
      "In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.\n",
      "For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.\n",
      "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.\n",
      "And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.\n",
      "Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said to you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide any thing from me of all the things that he said to you.\n",
      "And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seems him good.\n",
      "And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.\n",
      "And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\n",
      "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.\n",
      "And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\n",
      "And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.\n",
      "So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\n",
      "And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\n",
      "And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.\n",
      "And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.\n",
      "Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.\n",
      "Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.\n",
      "And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.\n",
      "And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.\n",
      "And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.\n",
      "And when he came, see, Eli sat on a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\n",
      "And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.\n",
      "Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.\n",
      "And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?\n",
      "And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.\n",
      "And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came on her.\n",
      "And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for you have born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.\n",
      "And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.\n",
      "And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.\n",
      "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.\n",
      "When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.\n",
      "And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\n",
      "And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.\n",
      "Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.\n",
      "But the hand of the LORD was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.\n",
      "And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.\n",
      "They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.\n",
      "And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had tumors in their secret parts.\n",
      "Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.\n",
      "So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.\n",
      "And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.\n",
      "And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.\n",
      "And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with which we shall send it to his place.\n",
      "And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.\n",
      "Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.\n",
      "Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.\n",
      "Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?\n",
      "Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:\n",
      "And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.\n",
      "And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.\n",
      "And the men did so; and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:\n",
      "And they laid the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.\n",
      "And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Bethshemesh.\n",
      "And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.\n",
      "And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt offering to the LORD.\n",
      "And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.\n",
      "And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.\n",
      "And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;\n",
      "And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, where on they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.\n",
      "And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.\n",
      "And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?\n",
      "And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come you down, and fetch it up to you.\n",
      "And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, while the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.\n",
      "And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.\n",
      "And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.\n",
      "And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.\n",
      "And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.\n",
      "And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.\n",
      "And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.\n",
      "And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.\n",
      "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Till now has the LORD helped us.\n",
      "So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.\n",
      "And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n",
      "And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.\n",
      "And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.\n",
      "And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.\n",
      "Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.\n",
      "And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.\n",
      "Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah,\n",
      "And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.\n",
      "But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.\n",
      "According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, with which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you.\n",
      "Now therefore listen to their voice: however, yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.\n",
      "And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.\n",
      "And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.\n",
      "And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.\n",
      "And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.\n",
      "And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\n",
      "And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.\n",
      "And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\n",
      "He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you shall be his servants.\n",
      "And you shall cry out in that day because of your king which you shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.\n",
      "Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;\n",
      "That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.\n",
      "And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go you every man to his city.\n",
      "Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.\n",
      "And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.\n",
      "And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses.\n",
      "And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.\n",
      "And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.\n",
      "And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.\n",
      "Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?\n",
      "And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.\n",
      "(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)\n",
      "Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.\n",
      "And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?\n",
      "And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:\n",
      "As soon as you be come into the city, you shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time you shall find him.\n",
      "And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.\n",
      "Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,\n",
      "To morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.\n",
      "And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man whom I spoke to you of! this same shall reign over my people.\n",
      "Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.\n",
      "And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for you shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.\n",
      "And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?\n",
      "And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you so to me?\n",
      "And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the most chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.\n",
      "And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for to this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.\n",
      "And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul on the top of the house.\n",
      "And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\n",
      "And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand you still a while, that I may show you the word of God.\n",
      "Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?\n",
      "When you are departed from me to day, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went to seek are found: and, see, your father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?\n",
      "Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\n",
      "And they will salute you, and give you two loaves of bread; which you shall receive of their hands.\n",
      "After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:\n",
      "And the Spirit of the LORD will come on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.\n",
      "And let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do as occasion serve you; for God is with you.\n",
      "And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.\n",
      "And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.\n",
      "And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\n",
      "And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?\n",
      "And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.\n",
      "And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.\n",
      "And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray you, what Samuel said to you.\n",
      "And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.\n",
      "And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;\n",
      "And said to the children of Israel, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:\n",
      "And you have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.\n",
      "And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\n",
      "When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.\n",
      "Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he has hid himself among the stuff.\n",
      "And they ran and fetched him there: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.\n",
      "And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.\n",
      "Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.\n",
      "And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.\n",
      "But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.\n",
      "Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.\n",
      "And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach on all Israel.\n",
      "And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to you.\n",
      "Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.\n",
      "And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.\n",
      "And the Spirit of God came on Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.\n",
      "And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.\n",
      "And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.\n",
      "And they said to the messengers that came, Thus shall you say to the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, you shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.\n",
      "Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.\n",
      "And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.\n",
      "And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.\n",
      "And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.\n",
      "Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.\n",
      "And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.\n",
      "And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.\n",
      "And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and gray headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.\n",
      "Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.\n",
      "And they said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken ought of any man's hand.\n",
      "And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.\n",
      "When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.\n",
      "And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.\n",
      "And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.\n",
      "And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.\n",
      "And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.\n",
      "Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have desired! and, behold, the LORD has set a king over you.\n",
      "If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:\n",
      "But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.\n",
      "Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.\n",
      "Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.\n",
      "So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.\n",
      "And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.\n",
      "And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;\n",
      "And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.\n",
      "For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.\n",
      "Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:\n",
      "Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he has done for you.\n",
      "But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.\n",
      "Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,\n",
      "Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.\n",
      "And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.\n",
      "And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.\n",
      "And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.\n",
      "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.\n",
      "And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.\n",
      "And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.\n",
      "And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.\n",
      "And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;\n",
      "Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now on me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.\n",
      "And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom on Israel for ever.\n",
      "But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.\n",
      "And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.\n",
      "And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.\n",
      "And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:\n",
      "And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.\n",
      "Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:\n",
      "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his ax, and his mattock.\n",
      "Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\n",
      "So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.\n",
      "And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.\n",
      "Now it came to pass on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.\n",
      "And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;\n",
      "And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.\n",
      "And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\n",
      "The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.\n",
      "And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.\n",
      "And his armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn you; behold, I am with you according to your heart.\n",
      "Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to these men, and we will discover ourselves to them.\n",
      "If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.\n",
      "But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign to us.\n",
      "And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.\n",
      "And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.\n",
      "And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer slew after him.\n",
      "And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.\n",
      "And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.\n",
      "And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.\n",
      "Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.\n",
      "And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.\n",
      "And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.\n",
      "Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.\n",
      "Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.\n",
      "So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Bethaven.\n",
      "And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.\n",
      "And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.\n",
      "And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.\n",
      "But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: why he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.\n",
      "Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father straightly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint.\n",
      "Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.\n",
      "How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?\n",
      "And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.\n",
      "And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.\n",
      "Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, You have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.\n",
      "And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.\n",
      "And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD.\n",
      "And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.\n",
      "And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.\n",
      "And Saul said, Draw you near here, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.\n",
      "For, as the LORD lives, which saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.\n",
      "Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.\n",
      "Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.  And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.\n",
      "And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.\n",
      "Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, see, I must die.\n",
      "And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.\n",
      "And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.\n",
      "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.\n",
      "So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.\n",
      "And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.\n",
      "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:\n",
      "And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.\n",
      "And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\n",
      "And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.\n",
      "Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD.\n",
      "Thus said the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.\n",
      "Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\n",
      "And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\n",
      "And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\n",
      "And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\n",
      "And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.\n",
      "And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatted calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\n",
      "Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,\n",
      "It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.\n",
      "And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.\n",
      "And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.\n",
      "And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?\n",
      "And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\n",
      "Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.\n",
      "And Samuel said, When you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?\n",
      "And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.\n",
      "Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly on the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?\n",
      "And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.\n",
      "But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.\n",
      "And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.\n",
      "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.\n",
      "And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.\n",
      "And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.\n",
      "And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.\n",
      "And Samuel said to him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, that is better than you.\n",
      "And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.\n",
      "Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.\n",
      "So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.\n",
      "Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.\n",
      "And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.\n",
      "Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.\n",
      "And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.\n",
      "And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.\n",
      "And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.\n",
      "And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?\n",
      "And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.\n",
      "But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.\n",
      "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.\n",
      "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.\n",
      "Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these.\n",
      "And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.\n",
      "And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and with of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\n",
      "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\n",
      "But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.\n",
      "And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.\n",
      "Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.\n",
      "And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.\n",
      "Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.\n",
      "Why Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, which is with the sheep.\n",
      "And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.\n",
      "And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.\n",
      "And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was on Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\n",
      "Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.\n",
      "And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.\n",
      "And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.\n",
      "And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.\n",
      "And he had an helmet of brass on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.\n",
      "And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.\n",
      "And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.\n",
      "And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.\n",
      "If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.\n",
      "And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.\n",
      "When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.\n",
      "Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.\n",
      "And the three oldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\n",
      "And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.\n",
      "But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.\n",
      "And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.\n",
      "And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;\n",
      "And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.\n",
      "Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\n",
      "And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.\n",
      "For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.\n",
      "And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.\n",
      "And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.\n",
      "And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.\n",
      "And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?\n",
      "And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.\n",
      "And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.\n",
      "And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?\n",
      "And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.\n",
      "And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.\n",
      "And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\n",
      "And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.\n",
      "And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:\n",
      "And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.\n",
      "Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.\n",
      "David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with you.\n",
      "And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass on his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.\n",
      "And David girded his sword on his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.\n",
      "And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.\n",
      "And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield went before him.\n",
      "And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.\n",
      "And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n",
      "And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\n",
      "Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.\n",
      "This day will the LORD deliver you into my hand; and I will smite you, and take your head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.\n",
      "And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew near to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\n",
      "And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.\n",
      "So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.\n",
      "Therefore David ran, and stood on the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.\n",
      "And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.  And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.\n",
      "And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.\n",
      "And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.\n",
      "And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.\n",
      "And the king said, Inquire you whose son the stripling is.\n",
      "And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.\n",
      "And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.\n",
      "And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.\n",
      "Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.\n",
      "And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\n",
      "And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.\n",
      "And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.\n",
      "And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\n",
      "And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?\n",
      "And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.\n",
      "And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.\n",
      "And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.\n",
      "Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n",
      "And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.\n",
      "Why when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.\n",
      "But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.\n",
      "And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.  For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.\n",
      "And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?\n",
      "But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.\n",
      "And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.\n",
      "And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Why Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.\n",
      "And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son in law.\n",
      "And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?\n",
      "And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.\n",
      "And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.\n",
      "Why David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.\n",
      "And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.\n",
      "And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.\n",
      "Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.\n",
      "And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.\n",
      "But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:\n",
      "And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and what I see, that I will tell you.\n",
      "And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been to you-ward very good:\n",
      "For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice: why then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?\n",
      "And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD lives, he shall not be slain.\n",
      "And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.  And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.\n",
      "And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.\n",
      "And the evil spirit from the LORD was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.\n",
      "And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.\n",
      "Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.\n",
      "So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.\n",
      "And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.\n",
      "And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.\n",
      "And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.\n",
      "And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.\n",
      "And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?\n",
      "So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelled in Naioth.\n",
      "And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.\n",
      "And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.\n",
      "And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.\n",
      "Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.\n",
      "And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.\n",
      "And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?\n",
      "And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?\n",
      "And he said to him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.\n",
      "And David swore moreover, and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in your eyes; and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.\n",
      "Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.\n",
      "And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at even.\n",
      "If your father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.\n",
      "If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.\n",
      "Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?\n",
      "And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then would not I tell it you?\n",
      "Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answer you roughly?\n",
      "And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.\n",
      "And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;\n",
      "The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.\n",
      "And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:\n",
      "But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.\n",
      "So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.\n",
      "And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.\n",
      "Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.\n",
      "And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.\n",
      "And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.\n",
      "And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives.\n",
      "But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away.\n",
      "And as touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever.\n",
      "So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.\n",
      "And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.\n",
      "Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why comes not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?\n",
      "And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:\n",
      "And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he comes not to the king's table.\n",
      "Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother's nakedness?\n",
      "For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Why now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.\n",
      "And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what has he done?\n",
      "And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.\n",
      "So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.\n",
      "And he said to his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\n",
      "And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?\n",
      "And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.\n",
      "But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.\n",
      "And Jonathan gave his artillery to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.\n",
      "And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.\n",
      "And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for as much as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.\n",
      "Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?\n",
      "And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.\n",
      "Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or what there is present.\n",
      "And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.\n",
      "And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.\n",
      "So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.\n",
      "Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the most chief of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.\n",
      "And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.\n",
      "And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.\n",
      "And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.\n",
      "And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\n",
      "And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.\n",
      "And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.\n",
      "Then said Achish to his servants, See, you see the man is mad: why then have you brought him to me?\n",
      "Have I need of mad men, that you have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?\n",
      "David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.\n",
      "And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.\n",
      "And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.\n",
      "And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelled with him all the while that David was in the hold.\n",
      "And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.\n",
      "When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)\n",
      "Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;\n",
      "That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?\n",
      "Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.\n",
      "And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\n",
      "Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.\n",
      "And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.\n",
      "And Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?\n",
      "Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?\n",
      "Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.\n",
      "And the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house.\n",
      "And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of the LORD.\n",
      "And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.\n",
      "And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.\n",
      "And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.\n",
      "And David said to Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.\n",
      "Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be in safeguard.\n",
      "Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.\n",
      "Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.\n",
      "And David's men said to him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?\n",
      "Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.\n",
      "So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.\n",
      "And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.\n",
      "And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.\n",
      "And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.\n",
      "Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.\n",
      "Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.\n",
      "Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver you up.\n",
      "Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.\n",
      "And David stayed in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.\n",
      "And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.\n",
      "And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.\n",
      "And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.\n",
      "And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David stayed in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.\n",
      "Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?\n",
      "Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.\n",
      "And Saul said, Blessed be you of the LORD; for you have compassion on me.\n",
      "Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very subtly.\n",
      "See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.\n",
      "And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.\n",
      "Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; why he came down into a rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.\n",
      "And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.\n",
      "But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.\n",
      "Why Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.\n",
      "And David went up from there, and dwelled in strong holds at Engedi.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.\n",
      "Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.\n",
      "And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.\n",
      "And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.\n",
      "And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.\n",
      "And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.\n",
      "So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.\n",
      "David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.\n",
      "And David said to Saul, Why hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?\n",
      "Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered you to day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you: but my eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.\n",
      "Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it.\n",
      "The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be on you.\n",
      "As said the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be on you.\n",
      "After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.\n",
      "The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "And he said to David, You are more righteous than I: for you have rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded you evil.\n",
      "And you have showed this day how that you have dealt well with me: for as much as when the LORD had delivered me into your hand, you killed me not.\n",
      "For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? why the LORD reward you good for that you have done to me this day.\n",
      "And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.\n",
      "Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.\n",
      "And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up to the hold.\n",
      "And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.\n",
      "Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.\n",
      "And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.\n",
      "And David sent out ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:\n",
      "And thus shall you say to him that lives in prosperity, Peace be both to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.\n",
      "And now I have heard that you have shearers: now your shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.\n",
      "Ask your young men, and they will show you. Why let the young men find favor in your eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatever comes to your hand to your servants, and to your son David.\n",
      "And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.\n",
      "And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.\n",
      "Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men, whom I know not from where they be?\n",
      "So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.\n",
      "And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.\n",
      "But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.\n",
      "But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:\n",
      "They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.\n",
      "Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.\n",
      "Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.\n",
      "And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.\n",
      "And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.\n",
      "Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has requited me evil for good.\n",
      "So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that urinates against the wall.\n",
      "And when Abigail saw David, she hurried, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,\n",
      "And fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be: and let your handmaid, I pray you, speak in your audience, and hear the words of your handmaid.\n",
      "Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.\n",
      "Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld you from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\n",
      "And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.\n",
      "I pray you, forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days.\n",
      "Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;\n",
      "That this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.\n",
      "And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me:\n",
      "And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.\n",
      "For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, which has kept me back from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any that urinates against the wall.\n",
      "So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.\n",
      "And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: why she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.\n",
      "But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.\n",
      "And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.\n",
      "And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.\n",
      "And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David sent us to you, to take you to him to wife.\n",
      "And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.\n",
      "And Abigail hurried, and arose and rode on an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.\n",
      "David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.\n",
      "But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.\n",
      "And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?\n",
      "Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.\n",
      "And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.\n",
      "David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.\n",
      "And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.\n",
      "Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.\n",
      "So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.\n",
      "Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.\n",
      "And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?\n",
      "David said furthermore, As the LORD lives, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.\n",
      "The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.\n",
      "So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen on them.\n",
      "Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:\n",
      "And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?\n",
      "And David said to Abner, Are not you a valiant man? and who is like to you in Israel? why then have you not kept your lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.\n",
      "This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed.  And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.\n",
      "And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.\n",
      "And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.\n",
      "Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.\n",
      "Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do you harm, because my soul was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.\n",
      "And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.\n",
      "The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed.\n",
      "And, behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.\n",
      "Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do great things, and also shall still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.\n",
      "And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.\n",
      "And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.\n",
      "And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.\n",
      "And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.\n",
      "And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?\n",
      "Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.\n",
      "And the time that David dwelled in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.\n",
      "And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.\n",
      "And Achish said, Where have you made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.\n",
      "And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.\n",
      "And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.\n",
      "And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you keeper of my head for ever.\n",
      "Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.\n",
      "And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.\n",
      "And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.\n",
      "And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\n",
      "Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.\n",
      "And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name to you.\n",
      "And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?\n",
      "And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.\n",
      "Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.\n",
      "And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.\n",
      "And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.\n",
      "And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.\n",
      "And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.\n",
      "Then said Samuel, Why then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become your enemy?\n",
      "And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David:\n",
      "Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing to you this day.\n",
      "Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.\n",
      "And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, listen you also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.\n",
      "But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.\n",
      "And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:\n",
      "And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.\n",
      "Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.\n",
      "And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.\n",
      "Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?  And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell to me to this day?\n",
      "And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for with which should he reconcile himself to his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?\n",
      "Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\n",
      "Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor you not.\n",
      "Why now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines.\n",
      "And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\n",
      "And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.\n",
      "Why now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as you be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.\n",
      "So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;\n",
      "And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.\n",
      "So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.\n",
      "Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.\n",
      "And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\n",
      "And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.\n",
      "And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.\n",
      "And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for you shall surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.\n",
      "So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.\n",
      "But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.\n",
      "And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;\n",
      "And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.\n",
      "And David said to him, To whom belong you? and from where are you? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.\n",
      "We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.\n",
      "And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this company.\n",
      "And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.\n",
      "And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode on camels, and fled.\n",
      "And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.\n",
      "And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.\n",
      "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.\n",
      "And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.\n",
      "Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.\n",
      "Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.\n",
      "For who will listen to you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike.\n",
      "And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.\n",
      "And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;\n",
      "To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,\n",
      "And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,\n",
      "And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,\n",
      "And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,\n",
      "And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.\n",
      "Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.\n",
      "And the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.\n",
      "And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.\n",
      "Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.\n",
      "And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword, and died with him.\n",
      "So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.\n",
      "And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelled in them.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.\n",
      "And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.\n",
      "And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.\n",
      "And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;\n",
      "All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.\n",
      "And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\n",
      "Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;\n",
      "It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.\n",
      "And David said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\n",
      "And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.\n",
      "And David said to the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?\n",
      "And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.\n",
      "And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.\n",
      "He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.\n",
      "So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.\n",
      "Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:\n",
      "And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.\n",
      "And David said to the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\n",
      "And David said to him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\n",
      "And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he smote him that he died.\n",
      "And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.\n",
      "And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:\n",
      "(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)\n",
      "The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!\n",
      "Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n",
      "You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.\n",
      "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\n",
      "Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.\n",
      "You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.\n",
      "How are the mighty fallen in the middle of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places.\n",
      "I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been to me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\n",
      "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.\n",
      "So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.\n",
      "And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelled in the cities of Hebron.\n",
      "And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.\n",
      "And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.\n",
      "And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.\n",
      "Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be you valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.\n",
      "But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;\n",
      "And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\n",
      "Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.\n",
      "And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n",
      "And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\n",
      "And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\n",
      "And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.\n",
      "Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.\n",
      "And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: why that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.\n",
      "And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.\n",
      "And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.\n",
      "And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.\n",
      "Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am.\n",
      "And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor.  But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.\n",
      "And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I smite you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?\n",
      "However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\n",
      "Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\n",
      "And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.\n",
      "Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere you bid the people return from following their brothers?\n",
      "And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.\n",
      "So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.\n",
      "And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.\n",
      "And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.\n",
      "But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and three score men died.\n",
      "And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.\n",
      "Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.\n",
      "And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;\n",
      "And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;\n",
      "And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;\n",
      "And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.\n",
      "And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.\n",
      "And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?\n",
      "Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?\n",
      "So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;\n",
      "To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.\n",
      "And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.\n",
      "And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.\n",
      "And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.\n",
      "And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.\n",
      "And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.\n",
      "And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, You sought for David in times past to be king over you:\n",
      "Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.\n",
      "And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.\n",
      "So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.\n",
      "And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\n",
      "And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.\n",
      "When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.\n",
      "Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?\n",
      "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.\n",
      "And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.\n",
      "And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.\n",
      "And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:\n",
      "Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.\n",
      "So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\n",
      "And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.\n",
      "And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.\n",
      "And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?\n",
      "Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him.\n",
      "And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.\n",
      "And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatever the king did pleased all the people.\n",
      "For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.\n",
      "And the king said to his servants, Know you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?\n",
      "And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.\n",
      "And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\n",
      "And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.\n",
      "And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)\n",
      "And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.\n",
      "And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.\n",
      "And they came thither into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.\n",
      "For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.\n",
      "And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.\n",
      "And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,\n",
      "When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:\n",
      "How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?\n",
      "And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.\n",
      "Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.\n",
      "So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.\n",
      "David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.\n",
      "In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.\n",
      "And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.\n",
      "Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.\n",
      "And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\n",
      "So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.\n",
      "And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.\n",
      "And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.\n",
      "And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.\n",
      "And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.\n",
      "And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,\n",
      "Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,\n",
      "And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.\n",
      "But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.\n",
      "The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.\n",
      "And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.\n",
      "And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.\n",
      "And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.\n",
      "And let it be, when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to smite the host of the Philistines.\n",
      "And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.\n",
      "Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.\n",
      "And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.\n",
      "And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.\n",
      "And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.\n",
      "And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on cornets, and on cymbals.\n",
      "And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.\n",
      "And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.\n",
      "And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?\n",
      "So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.\n",
      "And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.\n",
      "And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.\n",
      "And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatted calves.\n",
      "And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.\n",
      "So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.\n",
      "And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.\n",
      "And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.\n",
      "And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.\n",
      "And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.\n",
      "Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!\n",
      "And David said to Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.\n",
      "And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in my own sight: and of the maidservants which you have spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.\n",
      "Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;\n",
      "That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.\n",
      "And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.\n",
      "And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,\n",
      "Go and tell my servant David, Thus said the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?\n",
      "Whereas I have not dwelled in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.\n",
      "In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build you not me an house of cedar?\n",
      "Now therefore so shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:\n",
      "And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.\n",
      "Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,\n",
      "And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that he will make you an house.\n",
      "And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n",
      "He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.\n",
      "I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:\n",
      "But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.\n",
      "And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.\n",
      "According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.\n",
      "Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?\n",
      "And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?\n",
      "And what can David say more to you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant.\n",
      "For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them.\n",
      "Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.\n",
      "And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for your land, before your people, which you redeemed to you from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?\n",
      "For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you for ever: and you, LORD, are become their God.\n",
      "And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.\n",
      "And let your name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you.\n",
      "For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you an house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.\n",
      "And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words be true, and you have promised this goodness to your servant:\n",
      "Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.\n",
      "And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.\n",
      "David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.\n",
      "And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.\n",
      "And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\n",
      "Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.\n",
      "And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.\n",
      "When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,\n",
      "Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:\n",
      "Which also king David did dedicate to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;\n",
      "Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.\n",
      "And David got him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.\n",
      "And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.\n",
      "And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.\n",
      "And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;\n",
      "And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;\n",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.\n",
      "And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?\n",
      "And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him to David, the king said to him, Are you Ziba?  And he said, Your servant is he.\n",
      "And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, which is lame on his feet.\n",
      "And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.\n",
      "Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.\n",
      "Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!\n",
      "And David said to him, Fear not: for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.\n",
      "And he bowed himself, and said, What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?\n",
      "Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given to your master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.\n",
      "You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.\n",
      "Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.\n",
      "And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelled in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.\n",
      "So Mephibosheth dwelled in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters to you? has not David rather sent his servants to you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?\n",
      "Why Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.\n",
      "When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.\n",
      "And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.\n",
      "And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.\n",
      "And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.\n",
      "When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:\n",
      "And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you.\n",
      "Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seems him good.\n",
      "And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him, to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.\n",
      "And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.\n",
      "And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.\n",
      "And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.\n",
      "And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.\n",
      "And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.\n",
      "And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.\n",
      "And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.\n",
      "And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\n",
      "And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned to her house.\n",
      "And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.\n",
      "And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.\n",
      "And when Uriah was come to him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.\n",
      "And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.\n",
      "But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.\n",
      "And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Came you not from your journey? why then did you not go down to your house?\n",
      "And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.\n",
      "And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let you depart. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.\n",
      "And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\n",
      "And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may be smitten, and die.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men were.\n",
      "And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.\n",
      "Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\n",
      "And charged the messenger, saying, When you have made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,\n",
      "And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why approached you so near to the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?\n",
      "Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\n",
      "So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.\n",
      "And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entering of the gate.\n",
      "And the shooters shot from off the wall on your servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\n",
      "Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.\n",
      "And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.\n",
      "And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.\n",
      "And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.\n",
      "The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:\n",
      "But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.\n",
      "And there came a travelers to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.\n",
      "And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:\n",
      "And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.\n",
      "And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;\n",
      "And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to you such and such things.\n",
      "Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house; because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.\n",
      "Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.\n",
      "For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\n",
      "And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.\n",
      "However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.\n",
      "And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.\n",
      "David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.\n",
      "And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?\n",
      "But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.\n",
      "Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.\n",
      "Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.\n",
      "And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?\n",
      "But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.\n",
      "And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.\n",
      "And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.\n",
      "And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.\n",
      "And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.\n",
      "Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.\n",
      "And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.\n",
      "And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.\n",
      "And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.\n",
      "And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.\n",
      "But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.\n",
      "And he said to him, Why are you, being the king's son, lean from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\n",
      "And Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.\n",
      "So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.\n",
      "Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.\n",
      "So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.\n",
      "And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.\n",
      "And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.\n",
      "And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.\n",
      "And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.\n",
      "And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.\n",
      "However, he would not listen to her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.\n",
      "Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.\n",
      "And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.\n",
      "Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.\n",
      "And she had a garment of divers colors on her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.\n",
      "And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.\n",
      "And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.\n",
      "But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.\n",
      "And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\n",
      "And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep shearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.\n",
      "And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheep shearers; let the king, I beseech you, and his servants go with your servant.\n",
      "And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to you. And he pressed him: however, he would not go, but blessed him.\n",
      "Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?\n",
      "But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.\n",
      "Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.\n",
      "And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.  Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.\n",
      "And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.\n",
      "Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.\n",
      "And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.\n",
      "Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.\n",
      "But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.\n",
      "And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as your servant said, so it is.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\n",
      "But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.\n",
      "So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.\n",
      "And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\n",
      "Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.\n",
      "And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:\n",
      "And come to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.\n",
      "And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.\n",
      "And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.\n",
      "And your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.\n",
      "And, behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the earth.\n",
      "And the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give charge concerning you.\n",
      "And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.\n",
      "And the king said, Whoever said ought to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.\n",
      "Then said she, I pray you, let the king remember the LORD your God, that you would not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.\n",
      "Then the woman said, Let your handmaid, I pray you, speak one word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.\n",
      "And the woman said, Why then have you thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king does speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished.\n",
      "For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.\n",
      "Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.\n",
      "For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.\n",
      "Then your handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you.\n",
      "Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the thing that I shall ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.\n",
      "And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king has spoken: for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid:\n",
      "To fetch about this form of speech has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.\n",
      "And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.\n",
      "And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.\n",
      "So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.\n",
      "But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.\n",
      "And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.\n",
      "And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.\n",
      "So Absalom dwelled two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.\n",
      "Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.\n",
      "Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.\n",
      "Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?\n",
      "And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.\n",
      "So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\n",
      "And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.\n",
      "Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!\n",
      "And it was so, that when any man came near to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.\n",
      "And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.\n",
      "For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.\n",
      "And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.\n",
      "But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.\n",
      "And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.\n",
      "And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.\n",
      "And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.\n",
      "And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil on us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall appoint.\n",
      "And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.\n",
      "And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.\n",
      "And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n",
      "Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.\n",
      "Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brothers: mercy and truth be with you.\n",
      "And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be.\n",
      "And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.\n",
      "And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\n",
      "And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.\n",
      "And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:\n",
      "But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.\n",
      "The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\n",
      "See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.\n",
      "Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.\n",
      "And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.\n",
      "And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\n",
      "And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head:\n",
      "To whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden to me:\n",
      "But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant till now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.\n",
      "And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.\n",
      "Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me every thing that you can hear.\n",
      "So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.\n",
      "And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.\n",
      "And the king said to Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.\n",
      "And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he stays at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.\n",
      "Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, your are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.\n",
      "And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.\n",
      "And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.\n",
      "And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:\n",
      "The LORD has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.\n",
      "Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.\n",
      "And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have you done so?\n",
      "And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.\n",
      "It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.\n",
      "And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.\n",
      "And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.\n",
      "And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.\n",
      "And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?\n",
      "And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.\n",
      "And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.\n",
      "Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.\n",
      "And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.\n",
      "So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.\n",
      "And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counceled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\n",
      "Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:\n",
      "And I will come on him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:\n",
      "And I will bring back all the people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.\n",
      "And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.\n",
      "Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he said.\n",
      "And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you.\n",
      "And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.\n",
      "For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.\n",
      "Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.\n",
      "And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.\n",
      "Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.\n",
      "So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.\n",
      "Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.\n",
      "And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil on Absalom.\n",
      "Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counceled.\n",
      "Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.\n",
      "Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.\n",
      "Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.\n",
      "And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.\n",
      "And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counceled against you.\n",
      "Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.\n",
      "And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.\n",
      "Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.\n",
      "And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.\n",
      "So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,\n",
      "Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,\n",
      "And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.\n",
      "And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.\n",
      "And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.\n",
      "But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you succor us out of the city.\n",
      "And the king said to them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.\n",
      "And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.\n",
      "So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;\n",
      "Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.\n",
      "For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.\n",
      "And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode on a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.\n",
      "And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.\n",
      "And Joab said to the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.\n",
      "And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.\n",
      "Otherwise I should have worked falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.\n",
      "Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.\n",
      "And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.\n",
      "And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.\n",
      "And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones on him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.\n",
      "Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.\n",
      "Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.\n",
      "And Joab said to him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.\n",
      "Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.\n",
      "Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?\n",
      "But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.\n",
      "And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.\n",
      "And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.\n",
      "And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings.\n",
      "And the watchman said, Me thinks the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.\n",
      "And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.\n",
      "And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.\n",
      "And the king said to him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.\n",
      "And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.\n",
      "And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.\n",
      "And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!\n",
      "And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.\n",
      "And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.\n",
      "And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\n",
      "But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!\n",
      "And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, which this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;\n",
      "In that you love your enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.\n",
      "Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now.\n",
      "Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.\n",
      "And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.\n",
      "And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king back?\n",
      "And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.\n",
      "You are my brothers, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?\n",
      "And say you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.\n",
      "And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return you, and all your servants.\n",
      "So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.\n",
      "And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\n",
      "And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.\n",
      "And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;\n",
      "And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.\n",
      "For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.\n",
      "But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?\n",
      "And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?\n",
      "Therefore the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore to him.\n",
      "And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why went not you with me, Mephibosheth?\n",
      "And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.\n",
      "And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.\n",
      "For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?\n",
      "And the king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.\n",
      "And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, for as much as my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.\n",
      "And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.\n",
      "Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.\n",
      "And the king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem.\n",
      "And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?\n",
      "I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?\n",
      "Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?\n",
      "Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.\n",
      "And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you: and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.\n",
      "And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.\n",
      "Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.\n",
      "And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?\n",
      "And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then be you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?\n",
      "And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.\n",
      "And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.\n",
      "So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah joined to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.\n",
      "Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.\n",
      "So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.\n",
      "And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take you your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.\n",
      "And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and on it a girdle with a sword fastened on his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.\n",
      "And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.\n",
      "But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favors Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.\n",
      "And Amasa wallowed in blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth on him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.\n",
      "When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.\n",
      "And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.\n",
      "Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.\n",
      "And when he was come near to her, the woman said, Are you Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.\n",
      "Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.\n",
      "I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?\n",
      "And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.\n",
      "The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.\n",
      "Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.\n",
      "Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:\n",
      "And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:\n",
      "And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:\n",
      "And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.\n",
      "Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.\n",
      "And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)\n",
      "Why David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and with which shall I make the atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?\n",
      "And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. And he said, What you shall say, that will I do for you.\n",
      "And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,\n",
      "Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.\n",
      "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.\n",
      "But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:\n",
      "And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.\n",
      "And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped on them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\n",
      "And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.\n",
      "And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:\n",
      "And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.\n",
      "And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.\n",
      "Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.\n",
      "And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.\n",
      "But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.\n",
      "And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.\n",
      "And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.\n",
      "And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.\n",
      "These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.\n",
      "And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:\n",
      "And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;\n",
      "The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.\n",
      "I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.\n",
      "When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;\n",
      "The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;\n",
      "In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.\n",
      "Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.\n",
      "There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.\n",
      "He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.\n",
      "And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen on the wings of the wind.\n",
      "And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.\n",
      "Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.\n",
      "The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.\n",
      "And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.\n",
      "And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.\n",
      "He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;\n",
      "He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.\n",
      "They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.\n",
      "He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.\n",
      "The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.\n",
      "For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.\n",
      "For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.\n",
      "I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.\n",
      "Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.\n",
      "With the merciful you will show yourself merciful, and with the upright man you will show yourself upright.\n",
      "With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself unsavory.\n",
      "And the afflicted people you will save: but your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.\n",
      "For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.\n",
      "For by you I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.\n",
      "As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.\n",
      "For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?\n",
      "God is my strength and power: and he makes my way perfect.\n",
      "He makes my feet like hinds' feet: and sets me on my high places.\n",
      "He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.\n",
      "You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great.\n",
      "You have enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.\n",
      "I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.\n",
      "And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yes, they are fallen under my feet.\n",
      "For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me.\n",
      "You have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.\n",
      "They looked, but there was none to save; even to the LORD, but he answered them not.\n",
      "Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.\n",
      "You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.\n",
      "Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.\n",
      "Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.\n",
      "The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.\n",
      "It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.\n",
      "And that brings me forth from my enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.\n",
      "Therefore I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to your name.\n",
      "He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever more.\n",
      "Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,\n",
      "The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.\n",
      "The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.\n",
      "And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.\n",
      "Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.\n",
      "But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:\n",
      "But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.\n",
      "These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.\n",
      "And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:\n",
      "He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword: and the LORD worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.\n",
      "And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.\n",
      "But he stood in the middle of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD worked a great victory.\n",
      "And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.\n",
      "And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!\n",
      "And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out to the LORD.\n",
      "And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.\n",
      "And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.\n",
      "Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: however, he attained not to the first three.\n",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow:\n",
      "And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.\n",
      "These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.\n",
      "He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.\n",
      "Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,\n",
      "Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,\n",
      "Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\n",
      "Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,\n",
      "Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,\n",
      "Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,\n",
      "Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,\n",
      "Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,\n",
      "Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,\n",
      "Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,\n",
      "Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,\n",
      "Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,\n",
      "Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,\n",
      "Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armor bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,\n",
      "Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,\n",
      "Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.\n",
      "And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.\n",
      "For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the number of the people.\n",
      "And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD your God add to the people, how many soever they be, an hundred times, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?\n",
      "Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.\n",
      "And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:\n",
      "Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,\n",
      "And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.\n",
      "So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.\n",
      "And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.\n",
      "And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.\n",
      "For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,\n",
      "Go and say to David, Thus said the LORD, I offer you three things; choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.\n",
      "So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.\n",
      "And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.\n",
      "So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.\n",
      "And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.\n",
      "And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, See, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father's house.\n",
      "And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\n",
      "And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.\n",
      "And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face on the ground.\n",
      "And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.\n",
      "And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.\n",
      "All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD your God accept you.\n",
      "And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.\n",
      "And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.\n",
      "Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.\n",
      "Why his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.\n",
      "So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.\n",
      "And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.\n",
      "Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.\n",
      "And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.\n",
      "And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.\n",
      "But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.\n",
      "And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:\n",
      "But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.\n",
      "Why Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?\n",
      "Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.\n",
      "Go and get you in to king David, and say to him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?\n",
      "Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.\n",
      "And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.\n",
      "And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What would you?\n",
      "And she said to him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.\n",
      "And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:\n",
      "And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon your servant has he not called.\n",
      "And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.\n",
      "Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.\n",
      "And, see, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.\n",
      "And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.\n",
      "And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?\n",
      "For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.\n",
      "But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not called.\n",
      "Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it to your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\n",
      "Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.\n",
      "And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,\n",
      "Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.\n",
      "Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.\n",
      "And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.\n",
      "The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:\n",
      "And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.\n",
      "Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.\n",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.\n",
      "As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.\n",
      "So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.\n",
      "And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.\n",
      "And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.\n",
      "And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?\n",
      "And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings.\n",
      "And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.\n",
      "And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule:\n",
      "And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.\n",
      "And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.\n",
      "And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.\n",
      "And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.\n",
      "And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.\n",
      "And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n",
      "And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, see, he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.\n",
      "And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.\n",
      "So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.\n",
      "Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,\n",
      "I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;\n",
      "And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself:\n",
      "That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.\n",
      "Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.\n",
      "Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.\n",
      "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.\n",
      "And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.\n",
      "Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do to him; but his hoar head bring you down to the grave with blood.\n",
      "So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.\n",
      "And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Then sat Solomon on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.\n",
      "And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.\n",
      "He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to you. And she said, Say on.\n",
      "And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however, the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.\n",
      "And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.\n",
      "And he said, Speak, I pray you, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say you no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.\n",
      "And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.\n",
      "Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.\n",
      "Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say me not no. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say you no.\n",
      "And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother to wife.\n",
      "And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.\n",
      "Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.\n",
      "Now therefore, as the LORD lives, which has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\n",
      "And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him that he died.\n",
      "And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.\n",
      "So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.\n",
      "Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n",
      "And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.\n",
      "And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.\n",
      "And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.\n",
      "And the LORD shall return his blood on his own head, who fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.\n",
      "Their blood shall therefore return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed for ever: but on David, and on his seed, and on his house, and on his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.\n",
      "So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\n",
      "And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.\n",
      "And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any where.\n",
      "For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.\n",
      "And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelled in Jerusalem many days.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.\n",
      "And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.\n",
      "And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.\n",
      "And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and protested to you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, that you shall surely die? and you said to me, The word that I have heard is good.\n",
      "Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?\n",
      "The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head;\n",
      "And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.\n",
      "So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell on him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.\n",
      "And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.\n",
      "Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.\n",
      "And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.\n",
      "And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.\n",
      "In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.\n",
      "And Solomon said, You have showed to your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.\n",
      "And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.\n",
      "And your servant is in the middle of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.\n",
      "Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?\n",
      "And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.\n",
      "And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;\n",
      "Behold, I have done according to your words: see, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like to you.\n",
      "And I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like to you all your days.\n",
      "And if you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.\n",
      "And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.\n",
      "Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.\n",
      "And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.\n",
      "And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.\n",
      "And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.\n",
      "And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.\n",
      "And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.\n",
      "And the other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. And this said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.\n",
      "Then said the king, The one said, This is my son that lives, and your son is the dead: and the other said, No; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living.\n",
      "And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.\n",
      "And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.\n",
      "Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her bowels yearned on her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither my nor yours, but divide it.\n",
      "Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.\n",
      "And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.\n",
      "So king Solomon was king over all Israel.\n",
      "And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,\n",
      "Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.\n",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:\n",
      "And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:\n",
      "And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.\n",
      "And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.\n",
      "And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:\n",
      "The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:\n",
      "The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:\n",
      "The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:\n",
      "Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:\n",
      "The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, three score great cities with walls and brazen bars:\n",
      "Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:\n",
      "Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:\n",
      "Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:\n",
      "Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:\n",
      "Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:\n",
      "Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.\n",
      "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.\n",
      "And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.\n",
      "And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and three score measures of meal,\n",
      "Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl.\n",
      "For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.\n",
      "And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.\n",
      "And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.\n",
      "And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.\n",
      "Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.\n",
      "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.\n",
      "And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.\n",
      "For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.\n",
      "And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.\n",
      "And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.\n",
      "And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\n",
      "And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\n",
      "And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,\n",
      "You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.\n",
      "But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.\n",
      "And, behold, I purpose to build an house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build an house to my name.\n",
      "Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given to David a wise son over this great people.\n",
      "And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.\n",
      "My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.\n",
      "So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.\n",
      "And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.\n",
      "And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.\n",
      "And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.\n",
      "And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.\n",
      "And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;\n",
      "Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that worked in the work.\n",
      "And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.\n",
      "And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.\n",
      "And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.\n",
      "And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.\n",
      "And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:\n",
      "The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.\n",
      "And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.\n",
      "The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.\n",
      "So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.\n",
      "And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.\n",
      "And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,\n",
      "Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke to David your father:\n",
      "And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.\n",
      "So Solomon built the house, and finished it.\n",
      "And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.\n",
      "And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.\n",
      "And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.\n",
      "And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.\n",
      "And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.\n",
      "And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.\n",
      "So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.\n",
      "And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.\n",
      "And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.\n",
      "And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.\n",
      "And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.\n",
      "The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.\n",
      "And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.\n",
      "And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n",
      "And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.\n",
      "And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.\n",
      "And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.\n",
      "The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.\n",
      "So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.\n",
      "And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.\n",
      "And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.\n",
      "And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.\n",
      "In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:\n",
      "And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.\n",
      "But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.\n",
      "He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.\n",
      "And it was covered with cedar above on the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.\n",
      "And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.\n",
      "And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.\n",
      "And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.\n",
      "Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.\n",
      "And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.\n",
      "All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.\n",
      "And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.\n",
      "And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.\n",
      "And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.\n",
      "And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.\n",
      "He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and worked all his work.\n",
      "For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.\n",
      "And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:\n",
      "And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.\n",
      "And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.\n",
      "And the capitals that were on the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.\n",
      "And the capitals on the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about on the other capital.\n",
      "And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.\n",
      "And on the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.\n",
      "And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.\n",
      "And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.\n",
      "It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.\n",
      "And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.\n",
      "And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.\n",
      "And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:\n",
      "And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.\n",
      "And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.\n",
      "And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.\n",
      "And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.\n",
      "And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.\n",
      "And there were four supports to the four corners of one base: and the supports were of the very base itself.\n",
      "And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.\n",
      "For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.\n",
      "After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.\n",
      "Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and on every one of the ten bases one laver.\n",
      "And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.\n",
      "And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:\n",
      "The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;\n",
      "And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;\n",
      "And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;\n",
      "And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;\n",
      "And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.\n",
      "In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.\n",
      "And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.\n",
      "And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,\n",
      "And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,\n",
      "And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.\n",
      "So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.\n",
      "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.\n",
      "And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.\n",
      "And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.\n",
      "And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.\n",
      "And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.\n",
      "For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.\n",
      "And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.\n",
      "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,\n",
      "So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.\n",
      "Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.\n",
      "I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.\n",
      "And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)\n",
      "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,\n",
      "Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.\n",
      "And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build an house to my name, you did well that it was in your heart.\n",
      "Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house to my name.\n",
      "And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.\n",
      "And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:\n",
      "And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:\n",
      "Who have kept with your servant David my father that you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.\n",
      "Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.\n",
      "And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.\n",
      "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?\n",
      "Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you to day:\n",
      "That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may listen to the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.\n",
      "And listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.\n",
      "If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:\n",
      "Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\n",
      "When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication to you in this house:\n",
      "Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.\n",
      "When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:\n",
      "Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.\n",
      "If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;\n",
      "What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:\n",
      "Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)\n",
      "That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.\n",
      "Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;\n",
      "(For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;\n",
      "Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name.\n",
      "If your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever you shall send them, and shall pray to the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:\n",
      "Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.\n",
      "If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;\n",
      "Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication to you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;\n",
      "And so return to you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:\n",
      "Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,\n",
      "And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:\n",
      "For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:\n",
      "That your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them in all that they call for to you.\n",
      "For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.\n",
      "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.\n",
      "And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,\n",
      "Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.\n",
      "The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:\n",
      "That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.\n",
      "And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:\n",
      "That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.\n",
      "Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.\n",
      "And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.\n",
      "And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.\n",
      "The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.\n",
      "And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.\n",
      "On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,\n",
      "That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.\n",
      "And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my judgments:\n",
      "Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom on Israel for ever, as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.\n",
      "But if you shall at all turn from following me, you or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:\n",
      "Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:\n",
      "And at this house, which is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?\n",
      "And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold on other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore has the LORD brought on them all this evil.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,\n",
      "(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.\n",
      "And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.\n",
      "And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.\n",
      "And Hiram sent to the king six score talents of gold.\n",
      "And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.\n",
      "For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.\n",
      "And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,\n",
      "And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,\n",
      "And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n",
      "And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,\n",
      "Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, on those did Solomon levy a tribute of slavery to this day.\n",
      "But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.\n",
      "These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bore rule over the people that worked in the work.\n",
      "But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.\n",
      "And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.\n",
      "And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.\n",
      "And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.\n",
      "And they came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.\n",
      "And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.\n",
      "And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.\n",
      "And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.\n",
      "And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,\n",
      "And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.\n",
      "And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.\n",
      "However, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard.\n",
      "Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, which stand continually before you, and that hear your wisdom.\n",
      "Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he you king, to do judgment and justice.\n",
      "And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.\n",
      "And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.\n",
      "And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen to this day.\n",
      "And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.  So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.\n",
      "Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,\n",
      "Beside that he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.\n",
      "And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.\n",
      "And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.\n",
      "Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.\n",
      "The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.\n",
      "And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.\n",
      "And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.\n",
      "For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\n",
      "So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.\n",
      "And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.\n",
      "And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.\n",
      "And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.\n",
      "And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.\n",
      "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\n",
      "And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.\n",
      "But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:\n",
      "Of the nations concerning which the LORD said to the children of Israel, You shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.\n",
      "And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.\n",
      "For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.\n",
      "For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n",
      "And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.\n",
      "Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.\n",
      "And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared to him twice,\n",
      "And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.\n",
      "Why the LORD said to Solomon, For as much as this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.\n",
      "Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.\n",
      "However, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.\n",
      "And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.\n",
      "For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;\n",
      "(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)\n",
      "That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.\n",
      "And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.\n",
      "And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.\n",
      "And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.\n",
      "And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: however, let me go in any wise.\n",
      "And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:\n",
      "And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelled therein, and reigned in Damascus.\n",
      "And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.\n",
      "And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.\n",
      "And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.\n",
      "And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:\n",
      "And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:\n",
      "And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces: for thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you:\n",
      "(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)\n",
      "Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.\n",
      "However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:\n",
      "But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.\n",
      "And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.\n",
      "And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.\n",
      "And it shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.\n",
      "And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.\n",
      "Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?\n",
      "And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.\n",
      "And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelled in Egypt;)\n",
      "That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,\n",
      "Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.\n",
      "And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.\n",
      "And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do you advise that I may answer this people?\n",
      "And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.\n",
      "But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:\n",
      "And he said to them, What counsel give you that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which your father did put on us lighter?\n",
      "And the young men that were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to this people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.\n",
      "And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\n",
      "So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.\n",
      "And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;\n",
      "And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\n",
      "Why the king listened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n",
      "So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.\n",
      "But as for the children of Israel which dwelled in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n",
      "Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\n",
      "So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.\n",
      "And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.\n",
      "But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\n",
      "Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,\n",
      "Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.\n",
      "Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelled therein; and went out from there, and built Penuel.\n",
      "And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:\n",
      "If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.\n",
      "Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.\n",
      "And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.\n",
      "And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.\n",
      "And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.\n",
      "So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.\n",
      "And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.\n",
      "And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus said the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burnt on you.\n",
      "And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD has spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.\n",
      "The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.\n",
      "And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God sought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.\n",
      "And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.\n",
      "And the man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:\n",
      "For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.\n",
      "So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.\n",
      "Now there dwelled an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.\n",
      "And their father said to them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.\n",
      "And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,\n",
      "And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah? And he said, I am.\n",
      "Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.\n",
      "And he said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:\n",
      "For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.\n",
      "He said to him, I am a prophet also as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.\n",
      "So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:\n",
      "And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,\n",
      "But came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of your fathers.\n",
      "And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.\n",
      "And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.\n",
      "And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelled.\n",
      "And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.\n",
      "And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.\n",
      "And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.\n",
      "And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it on the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.\n",
      "And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!\n",
      "And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:\n",
      "For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.\n",
      "After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.\n",
      "And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.\n",
      "At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.\n",
      "And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray you, and disguise yourself, that you be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.\n",
      "And take with you ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell you what shall become of the child.\n",
      "And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to ask a thing of you for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shall you say to her: for it shall be, when she comes in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.\n",
      "And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings.\n",
      "Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, For as much as I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,\n",
      "And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you: and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes;\n",
      "But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:\n",
      "Therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man takes away dung, till it be all gone.\n",
      "Him that dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD has spoken it.\n",
      "Arise you therefore, get you to your own house: and when your feet enter into the city, the child shall die.\n",
      "And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.\n",
      "Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.\n",
      "For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.\n",
      "And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.\n",
      "And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;\n",
      "And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\n",
      "And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.\n",
      "And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.\n",
      "For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.\n",
      "And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:\n",
      "And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.\n",
      "And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.\n",
      "And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\n",
      "And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.\n",
      "Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\n",
      "And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.\n",
      "Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:\n",
      "Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.\n",
      "And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.\n",
      "And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.\n",
      "And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\n",
      "And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.\n",
      "And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.\n",
      "And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.\n",
      "But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.\n",
      "And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.\n",
      "And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.\n",
      "And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\n",
      "Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,\n",
      "There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\n",
      "So Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelled in Tirzah.\n",
      "Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.\n",
      "The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.\n",
      "And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.\n",
      "And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.\n",
      "Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:\n",
      "Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.\n",
      "In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.\n",
      "And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,\n",
      "For as much as I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel; and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;\n",
      "Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n",
      "Him that dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.\n",
      "In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.\n",
      "And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.\n",
      "And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.\n",
      "Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.\n",
      "For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.\n",
      "And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also slain the king: why all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.\n",
      "And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.\n",
      "For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he worked, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.\n",
      "But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.\n",
      "In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.\n",
      "And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.\n",
      "But Omri worked evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.\n",
      "For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.\n",
      "And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.\n",
      "And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.\n",
      "And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.\n",
      "In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.\n",
      "And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,\n",
      "Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.\n",
      "And it shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.\n",
      "So he went and did according to the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelled by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.\n",
      "And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\n",
      "And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.\n",
      "And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,\n",
      "Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you.\n",
      "So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\n",
      "And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your hand.\n",
      "And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\n",
      "And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for you and for your son.\n",
      "For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.\n",
      "And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.\n",
      "And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.\n",
      "And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?\n",
      "And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.\n",
      "And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?\n",
      "And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.\n",
      "And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.\n",
      "And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, your son lives.\n",
      "And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.\n",
      "And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.\n",
      "And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.\n",
      "And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:\n",
      "For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)\n",
      "And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.\n",
      "So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\n",
      "And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you that my lord Elijah?\n",
      "And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\n",
      "And he said, What have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?\n",
      "As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.\n",
      "And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.\n",
      "Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?\n",
      "And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.\n",
      "And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to day.\n",
      "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he that troubles Israel?\n",
      "And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim.\n",
      "Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.\n",
      "So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel.\n",
      "And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.\n",
      "Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.\n",
      "Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:\n",
      "And call you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.\n",
      "And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.\n",
      "And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.\n",
      "And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked.\n",
      "And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.\n",
      "And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.\n",
      "And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:\n",
      "And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.\n",
      "And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.\n",
      "And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time.  And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.\n",
      "And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.\n",
      "Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again.\n",
      "Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.\n",
      "And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.\n",
      "And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.\n",
      "And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.\n",
      "So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,\n",
      "And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there rises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down that the rain stop you not.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.\n",
      "And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\n",
      "And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and with how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.\n",
      "Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.\n",
      "And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.\n",
      "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.\n",
      "And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.\n",
      "And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for you.\n",
      "And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.\n",
      "And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, What do you here, Elijah?\n",
      "And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\n",
      "And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD.  And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:\n",
      "And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\n",
      "And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What do you here, Elijah?\n",
      "And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:\n",
      "And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.\n",
      "And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.\n",
      "Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.\n",
      "So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle on him.\n",
      "And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back again: for what have I done to you?\n",
      "And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.\n",
      "And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.\n",
      "And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus said Benhadad,\n",
      "Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.\n",
      "And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to your saying, I am yours, and all that I have.\n",
      "And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;\n",
      "Yet I will send my servants to you to morrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.\n",
      "Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.\n",
      "And all the elders and all the people said to him, Listen not to him, nor consent.\n",
      "Why he said to the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.\n",
      "And Benhadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.\n",
      "And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girds on his harness boast himself as he that puts it off.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.\n",
      "And, behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am the LORD.\n",
      "And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus said the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, You.\n",
      "Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.\n",
      "And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.\n",
      "And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.\n",
      "And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.\n",
      "So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.\n",
      "And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.\n",
      "And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.\n",
      "And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.\n",
      "And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.\n",
      "And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:\n",
      "And number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened to their voice, and did so.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.\n",
      "And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.\n",
      "And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus said the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.\n",
      "And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.\n",
      "But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell on twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.\n",
      "And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your life.\n",
      "So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Benhadad said, I pray you, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.\n",
      "Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Your brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.\n",
      "And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.\n",
      "And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you. And the man refused to smite him.\n",
      "Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall slay you.  And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.\n",
      "Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray you. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.\n",
      "So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes on his face.\n",
      "And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.\n",
      "And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.\n",
      "And he hurried, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.\n",
      "And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, Because you have let go out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.\n",
      "And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.\n",
      "And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.\n",
      "And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.\n",
      "And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.\n",
      "But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?\n",
      "And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.\n",
      "And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\n",
      "So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.\n",
      "And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:\n",
      "And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.\n",
      "And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.\n",
      "They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.\n",
      "And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.\n",
      "Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.\n",
      "And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n",
      "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.\n",
      "And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.\n",
      "And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,\n",
      "And will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.\n",
      "And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.\n",
      "Him that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.\n",
      "But there was none like to Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.\n",
      "And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.\n",
      "And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n",
      "See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.\n",
      "And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?\n",
      "And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.\n",
      "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?\n",
      "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.\n",
      "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Micaiah the son of Imlah.\n",
      "And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.\n",
      "And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.\n",
      "And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.\n",
      "And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.\n",
      "And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, what the LORD said to me, that will I speak.\n",
      "So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.\n",
      "And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?\n",
      "And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?\n",
      "And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.\n",
      "And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.\n",
      "And the LORD said to him, With which? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.\n",
      "Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.\n",
      "But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?\n",
      "And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;\n",
      "And say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.\n",
      "And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Listen, O people, every one of you.\n",
      "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\n",
      "But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.\n",
      "And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: why he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.\n",
      "And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the middle of the chariot.\n",
      "And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.\n",
      "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.\n",
      "And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\n",
      "And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.\n",
      "There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.\n",
      "Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.\n",
      "And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:\n",
      "For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.\n",
      "Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\n",
      "And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.\n",
      "But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?\n",
      "Now therefore thus said the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.\n",
      "And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why are you now turned back?\n",
      "And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.\n",
      "And he said to them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?\n",
      "And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.\n",
      "Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.\n",
      "And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty.  And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\n",
      "Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty.  And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.\n",
      "And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\n",
      "And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and sought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.\n",
      "Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.\n",
      "And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.\n",
      "So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.  And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.\n",
      "And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said to him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.\n",
      "And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.\n",
      "And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.\n",
      "And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.\n",
      "And Elijah said to him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on.\n",
      "And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\n",
      "And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.\n",
      "And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\n",
      "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\n",
      "He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;\n",
      "And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.\n",
      "And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.\n",
      "And they said to him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.\n",
      "And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.\n",
      "And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?\n",
      "And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.\n",
      "And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.\n",
      "And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.\n",
      "So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.\n",
      "And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.\n",
      "And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.\n",
      "And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.\n",
      "Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.\n",
      "And he worked evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.\n",
      "Nevertheless he joined to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.\n",
      "And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.\n",
      "But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.\n",
      "And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.\n",
      "And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.\n",
      "And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.\n",
      "So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!\n",
      "But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.\n",
      "And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\n",
      "And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you?  get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.  And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\n",
      "And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.\n",
      "But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.\n",
      "And he said, Thus said the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.\n",
      "For thus said the LORD, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink, both you, and your cattle, and your beasts.\n",
      "And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.\n",
      "And you shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.\n",
      "And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.\n",
      "And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:\n",
      "And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.\n",
      "And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.\n",
      "And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however, the slingers went about it, and smote it.\n",
      "And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even to the king of Edom: but they could not.\n",
      "Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.\n",
      "Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.\n",
      "And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.\n",
      "Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.\n",
      "And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.\n",
      "So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.\n",
      "Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.\n",
      "And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.\n",
      "And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.\n",
      "Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.\n",
      "And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.\n",
      "And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.\n",
      "And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.\n",
      "And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no child, and her husband is old.\n",
      "And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.\n",
      "And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.\n",
      "And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.\n",
      "And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.\n",
      "And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.\n",
      "And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.\n",
      "And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.\n",
      "And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.\n",
      "And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.\n",
      "Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.\n",
      "So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:\n",
      "Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:\n",
      "And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.\n",
      "Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?\n",
      "Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.\n",
      "And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.\n",
      "And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.\n",
      "And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.\n",
      "He went in therefore, and shut the door on them two, and prayed to the LORD.\n",
      "And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.\n",
      "Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.\n",
      "And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.\n",
      "Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.\n",
      "And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.\n",
      "And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.\n",
      "So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O you man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.\n",
      "But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.\n",
      "And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.\n",
      "And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus said the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.\n",
      "So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.\n",
      "Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.\n",
      "And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.\n",
      "And she said to her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.\n",
      "And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.\n",
      "And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.\n",
      "And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? why consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.\n",
      "And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you rent your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.\n",
      "So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.\n",
      "And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.\n",
      "But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.\n",
      "Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.\n",
      "And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he said to you, Wash, and be clean?\n",
      "Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like to the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\n",
      "And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.\n",
      "But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.\n",
      "And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth? for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.\n",
      "In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.\n",
      "And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.\n",
      "But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.\n",
      "So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?\n",
      "And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.\n",
      "And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.\n",
      "And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.\n",
      "But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went no where.\n",
      "And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?\n",
      "The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall stick to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.\n",
      "And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too strait for us.\n",
      "Let us go, we pray you, to Jordan, and take there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go you.\n",
      "And one said, Be content, I pray you, and go with your servants. And he answered, I will go.\n",
      "So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.\n",
      "But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.\n",
      "And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place.  And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.\n",
      "Therefore said he, Take it up to you. And he put out his hand, and took it.\n",
      "Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.\n",
      "And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.\n",
      "And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.\n",
      "Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?\n",
      "And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.\n",
      "And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.  And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.\n",
      "Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.\n",
      "And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?\n",
      "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.\n",
      "And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.\n",
      "And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.\n",
      "And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.\n",
      "And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?\n",
      "And he answered, You shall not smite them: would you smite those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.\n",
      "And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.\n",
      "And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.\n",
      "And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.\n",
      "And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.\n",
      "And he said, If the LORD do not help you, from where shall I help you?  out of the barn floor, or out of the wine press?\n",
      "And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.\n",
      "So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him: and she has hid her son.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.\n",
      "Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.\n",
      "But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?\n",
      "And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?\n",
      "Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.\n",
      "Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.\n",
      "And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?\n",
      "If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.\n",
      "And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.\n",
      "For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.\n",
      "Why they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.\n",
      "And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.\n",
      "Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come on us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.\n",
      "So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.\n",
      "And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.\n",
      "And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.\n",
      "And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.\n",
      "They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.\n",
      "And they went after them to Jordan: and, see, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.\n",
      "And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.\n",
      "And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.\n",
      "And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:\n",
      "And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.\n",
      "And so it fell out to him: for the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died.\n",
      "Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.\n",
      "And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.\n",
      "And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.\n",
      "And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.\n",
      "And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.\n",
      "And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?\n",
      "So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?\n",
      "And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You may certainly recover: however, the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.\n",
      "And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.\n",
      "And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.\n",
      "And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.\n",
      "So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.\n",
      "Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.\n",
      "In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.\n",
      "So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.\n",
      "Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.\n",
      "Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.\n",
      "And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.\n",
      "And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.\n",
      "And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\n",
      "And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this box of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead:\n",
      "And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;\n",
      "Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.\n",
      "So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.\n",
      "And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.\n",
      "And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.\n",
      "And you shall smite the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.\n",
      "For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:\n",
      "And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:\n",
      "And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.\n",
      "Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and his communication.\n",
      "And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.\n",
      "Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.\n",
      "So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.\n",
      "But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.\n",
      "So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.  And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.\n",
      "And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?\n",
      "So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not again.\n",
      "Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.\n",
      "And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and comes not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.\n",
      "And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?\n",
      "And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.\n",
      "And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.\n",
      "Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;\n",
      "Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.\n",
      "But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.\n",
      "And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.\n",
      "And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.\n",
      "And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.\n",
      "And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?\n",
      "And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.\n",
      "And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he stepped her under foot.\n",
      "And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.\n",
      "And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.\n",
      "Why they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:\n",
      "And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.\n",
      "And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,\n",
      "Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;\n",
      "Look even out the best and meet of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.\n",
      "But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?\n",
      "And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you that which is good in your eyes.\n",
      "Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.\n",
      "And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay you them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?\n",
      "Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.\n",
      "So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.\n",
      "And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,\n",
      "Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.\n",
      "And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.\n",
      "And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.\n",
      "And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.\n",
      "And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.\n",
      "And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.\n",
      "Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.\n",
      "And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.\n",
      "And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.\n",
      "And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.\n",
      "And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.\n",
      "And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.\n",
      "And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.\n",
      "And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house to this day.\n",
      "Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\n",
      "However, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.\n",
      "And the LORD said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\n",
      "But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.\n",
      "In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;\n",
      "From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.\n",
      "And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.\n",
      "But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.\n",
      "And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.\n",
      "And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;\n",
      "And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.\n",
      "And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.\n",
      "And you shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that comes within the ranges, let him be slain: and be you with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.\n",
      "And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.\n",
      "And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.\n",
      "And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.\n",
      "And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.\n",
      "And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.\n",
      "And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.\n",
      "But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.\n",
      "And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people.\n",
      "And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.\n",
      "And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.\n",
      "Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.\n",
      "In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.\n",
      "And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.\n",
      "But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\n",
      "And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passes the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,\n",
      "Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.\n",
      "But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.\n",
      "Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why repair you not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.\n",
      "And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.\n",
      "But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that worked on the house of the LORD,\n",
      "And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.\n",
      "However, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:\n",
      "But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.\n",
      "Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.\n",
      "The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.\n",
      "Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.\n",
      "For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.\n",
      "And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.\n",
      "And Jehoahaz sought the LORD, and the LORD listened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.\n",
      "(And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelled in their tents, as beforetime.\n",
      "Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)\n",
      "Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.\n",
      "Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.\n",
      "And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.\n",
      "And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow. And he put his hand on it: and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.\n",
      "And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them.\n",
      "And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite on the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.\n",
      "And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, You should have smitten five or six times; then had you smitten Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall smite Syria but thrice.\n",
      "And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.\n",
      "But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.\n",
      "And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.\n",
      "So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.\n",
      "In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.\n",
      "He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.\n",
      "And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.\n",
      "However, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.\n",
      "But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.\n",
      "He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.\n",
      "Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.\n",
      "And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.\n",
      "You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?\n",
      "But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.\n",
      "And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.\n",
      "And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.\n",
      "And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.\n",
      "And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.\n",
      "And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.\n",
      "He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.\n",
      "In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.\n",
      "He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.\n",
      "For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.\n",
      "Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.\n",
      "And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;\n",
      "Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.\n",
      "And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.\n",
      "And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\n",
      "This was the word of the LORD which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. And so it came to pass.\n",
      "Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.\n",

      "Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.\n",
      "In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.\n",

      "And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.\n",
      "And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.\n",

      "So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.\n",
      "And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.\n",
      "And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.\n",
      "And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.\n",
      "And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.\n",
      "And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.\n",
      "And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar.\n",
      "And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.\n",
      "And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.\n",
      "Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.\n",
      "And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.\n",
      "And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.\n",
      "Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.\n",
      "And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.\n",
      "Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.\n",
      "In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\n",
      "For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,\n",
      "And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.\n",
      "And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.\n",
      "And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:\n",
      "And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and worked wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:\n",
      "For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said to them, You shall not do this thing.\n",
      "Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.\n",
      "Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.\n",
      "And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.\n",
      "And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.\n",
      "And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\n",
      "Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.\n",
      "And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.\n",
      "For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.\n",
      "For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;\n",
      "Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.\n",
      "And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.\n",
      "And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.\n",
      "Why they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.\n",
      "Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.\n",
      "Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelled in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.\n",
      "However, every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelled.\n",
      "And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,\n",
      "And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\n",
      "So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.\n",
      "They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there.\n",
      "To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;\n",
      "With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:\n",
      "But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you worship, and to him shall you do sacrifice.\n",
      "And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do for ever more; and you shall not fear other gods.\n",
      "And the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods.\n",
      "But the LORD your God you shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.\n",
      "However, they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.\n",
      "So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.\n",
      "Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.\n",
      "Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.\n",
      "And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.\n",
      "He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.\n",
      "He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.\n",
      "For he held to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.\n",
      "And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.\n",
      "He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.\n",
      "And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.\n",
      "And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:\n",
      "Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.\n",
      "Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.\n",
      "And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.\n",
      "And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.\n",
      "At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.\n",
      "And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.\n",
      "And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.\n",
      "And Rabshakeh said to them, Speak you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?\n",
      "You say, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?\n",
      "Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.\n",
      "But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.\n",
      "How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?\n",
      "Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.\n",
      "Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.\n",
      "But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?\n",
      "Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:\n",
      "Thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:\n",
      "Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\n",
      "Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat you every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his cistern:\n",
      "Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.\n",
      "Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?\n",
      "Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?\n",
      "Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?\n",
      "But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.\n",
      "Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.\n",
      "And they said to him, Thus said Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.\n",
      "It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: why lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left.\n",
      "So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\n",
      "And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you say to your master, Thus said the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\n",
      "Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.\n",
      "So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.\n",
      "And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,\n",
      "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\n",
      "Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?\n",
      "Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?\n",
      "Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?\n",
      "And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.\n",
      "And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.\n",
      "LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.\n",
      "Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,\n",
      "And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.\n",
      "Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech you, save you us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD God, even you only.\n",
      "Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, That which you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.\n",
      "This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.\n",
      "Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.\n",
      "I have dig and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.\n",
      "Have you not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.\n",
      "Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.\n",
      "But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.\n",
      "Because your rage against me and your tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.\n",
      "And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.\n",
      "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.\n",
      "For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.\n",
      "Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.\n",
      "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.\n",
      "For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.\n",
      "And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.\n",
      "So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelled at Nineveh.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.\n",
      "Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,\n",
      "I beseech you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\n",
      "And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,\n",
      "Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus said the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.\n",
      "And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.\n",
      "And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?\n",
      "And Isaiah said, This sign shall you have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?\n",
      "And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.\n",
      "And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\n",
      "At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.\n",
      "And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.\n",
      "Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.\n",
      "And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.\n",
      "And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, said the LORD.\n",
      "And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.\n",
      "Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?\n",
      "And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.\n",
      "And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.\n",
      "And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:\n",
      "Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.\n",
      "But they listened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.\n",
      "And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,\n",
      "Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:\n",
      "Therefore thus said the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.\n",
      "And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.\n",
      "And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;\n",
      "Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.\n",
      "Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.\n",
      "And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:\n",
      "And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.\n",
      "And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.\n",
      "And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.\n",
      "And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,\n",
      "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:\n",
      "And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,\n",
      "To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.\n",
      "However, there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.\n",
      "And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.\n",
      "And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.\n",
      "And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,\n",
      "Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.\n",
      "So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.\n",
      "And she said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,\n",
      "Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:\n",
      "Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.\n",
      "But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;\n",
      "Because your heart was tender, and you have humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, said the LORD.\n",
      "Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place. And they brought the king word again.\n",
      "And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.\n",
      "And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.\n",
      "And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.\n",
      "And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.\n",
      "And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.\n",
      "And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.\n",
      "And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.\n",
      "Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brothers.\n",
      "And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.\n",
      "And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.\n",
      "And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.\n",
      "And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.\n",
      "And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.\n",
      "Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.\n",
      "And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.\n",
      "Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.\n",
      "And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.\n",
      "And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.\n",
      "And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burned men's bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.\n",
      "Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;\n",
      "But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.\n",
      "And like to him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him with.\n",
      "And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.\n",
      "And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.\n",
      "Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.\n",
      "And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.\n",
      "And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.\n",
      "And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaohnechoh.\n",
      "Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.\n",
      "In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.\n",
      "And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.\n",
      "Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;\n",
      "And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.\n",
      "And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.\n",
      "Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.\n",
      "At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.\n",
      "And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.\n",
      "And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.\n",
      "And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.\n",
      "And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.\n",
      "And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.\n",
      "And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.\n",
      "And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.\n",
      "Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n",
      "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.\n",
      "For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.\n",
      "And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.\n",
      "And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.\n",
      "And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.\n",
      "And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.\n",
      "So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.\n",
      "And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.\n",
      "And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:\n",
      "And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.\n",
      "And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.\n",
      "Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.\n",
      "But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.\n",
      "And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.\n",
      "And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.\n",
      "And the fire pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.\n",
      "The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.\n",
      "The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.\n",
      "And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:\n",
      "And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and three score men of the people of the land that were found in the city:\n",
      "And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:\n",
      "And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.\n",
      "And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.\n",
      "And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.\n",
      "And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.\n",
      "But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.\n",
      "And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;\n",
      "And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;\n",
      "And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.\n",
      "And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.\n",
